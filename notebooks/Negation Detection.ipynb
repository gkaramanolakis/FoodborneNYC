I remember it being a good experience as a child, so I decided to revisit the restaurant again as a teenager. But from what I recall, that experience was terrible. I ordered the only thing most people order from here, and that&#39;s the pork chop over rice. The dish was too salty and it almost tasted as if the pork may have been a bit past it&#39;s expiration date--rotten to say the least. I recall not finishing my dish at all.\\n\\nFast forward a couple years ahead, to last night and here we have another problem. Ever since that bad experience I had with the restaurant, I never wanted to go back. However, my boyfriend seems to enjoy the pork chop over rice so we came back for a late night bite. I didn&#39;t want to eat, so he and his friend both ordered.\\n\\nFrom what he told me, the pork was too salty, and he wasn&#39;t much of a tea drinker so we asked for a glass of water to wash down the food. While they were busy talking, I watched as the waiter grabbed a cup and scooped up ice from a dirty white commercial bucket that was sitting on the floor next to the sink to serve water with. I&#39;ve never worked at a restaurant, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not where ice should be taken from.\\n\\nAt this point, I should&#39;ve mentioned something, but I didn&#39;t which I terribly regret. Because hours later, we get home, go to sleep, and not even an hour into my sleep cycle, I hear my boyfriend get out of bed to grab the garbage can from under my table. I turn around and wake up to the sight of him vomiting into the trash can in deep pain. I was confused because he had only had two beers that night, and he definitely does not vomit off two beers.\\n\\nHe had cold sweats, his stomach was in pain and his body was unsettled. By this point, I knew he had gotten food poisoning. He spent the rest of the night vomiting and dry heaving, as if his body was attempting to regurgitate and remove something that would not leave his body. He was constantly running back and forth between the bedroom and the bathroom due to liquid bowels/watery stool that he was barely able to control. These are all severe symptoms of food poisoning.\\n\\nHe spent all of the next day sleeping in attempt to regain energy but his body was still extremely weak after resting for most of the day. This led me to call 311 to report the restaurant and call the poison center where I was informed that if these symptoms do continue, he&#39;d have to go to the hospital, which we both don&#39;t want to have to deal with.\\n\\nI always thought this restaurant was disgusting, but I haven&#39;t felt the need to make a negative review on it until now. I never understood how people even liked the food at this restaurant. The food is nothing special, if not terrible, and the service is lacking--but that goes for most Chinese restaurants in Flushing.\\n\\nMoral of the story, don&#39;t eat here unless you want to risk getting food poisoning and feeling like you&#39;re five steps closer to death.', 'label': 1.0}, {'text': u'Stopped off here before jumping on the path one night.

I don&#39;t want you to get mad and say I&#39;m ignoring you.&#34;  when we did give her our order, she asked my husband if he wanted juice and he said he only wanted water for now.

I might as well have not eaten anything at all. \\n\\n\\n\\nProsciutto Wrapped Dates: Just the opposite. These were sickly sweet. To the point of having to douse each bite with water.

As an individual who loves pork belly, I was also disappointed by this.

Also, the wait isn&#39;t too bad because there are some chairs around in the front as well as a bar. I came here around 10 PM after watching the NY Phil and had to wait about 30 minutes, which wasn&#39;t too bad. One thing about the seating policy is that the staff won&#39;t seat you until everyone in your party is present, so make sure your party is complete by the time they call your name, or else someone else will take your place! \\n\\nFor appetizers, we ordered the pork buns, crab croquettes, and house salad. The pork buns were delicious. The amount of meat was a decent amount and was juicy, not dry (like some other places). The sauce kicked it out of the park. I&#39;ve tried several pork buns from many other places and I have to say, Ippudo&#39;s sauce is my favorite so far. Also, they use butter lettuce in the bun and well, I&#39;m a sucker for butter lettuce. The crab croquettes were divine. The outside was golden brown and very crisp. The inside was so creamy, but light! When eating croquettes, I tend to feel really heavy after eating them but the ones here were not the case. The surrounding sauce matched the croquettes so harmoniously. As for the house salad, the dressing was really light and flavorful. The greens were fresh, except for a few leafs that looked a little sickly, but overall it was a really good, standard house salad. \\n\\nI ordered the Akaharu Modern ramen and it was soooo good. The broth was flavor packed and the noodles were so fresh. Also, the pieces of pork were very good and absorbed the flavor of the broth, making it even more savory. \\n\\nThe service here is really friendly and whether they are really busy or not doesn&#39;t make a difference because they are very efficient.

You can expect that from any open salad/chinese food bar, so eating from Cafe Duke&#39;s salad bar would be your fault. But the sushi served here is the lowest quality served in the city, which is saying a lot, and I have twice seen someone mop the floors and then prepare sandwiches for delivery without washing their hands. The worst part? The terrible attitude of the people that work there, particularly the night manager. \\n\\nThese guys will be in business forever because they are smart enough to take up space on a block next to law firms, investment banks and other businesses where people try and find the fastest food possible, without regard to cost. That&#39;s why they are able to have whole aisles of super-overpriced &#34;health bars&#34; and granola-nonsense (up to $6+ a granola bar!) just because they know that most of the people who walk in here are getting their meal paid for by their employer/client. I am just waiting for the day when the health inspector comes through and sweeps these guys away so that a half-decent deli can take their place.

The waitress was extremely accommodating. She said she would ask the chef about what was going on with the pie and informed us that there&#39;s usually a bit of vinegar that gets added at the end and we may have just gotten a particularly sour batch. After confirming that it wasn&#39;t a matter of food gone bad, the waitress offered to switch out our pie with a new one or something different and was very apologetic even though it didn&#39;t seem to be hers or anyone&#39;s fault.

I have been around restaurants all my life, my father is a well known GM in NYC has worked at several respected establishments, most notably Balthazar. This being said, I am always the one of my group of friends to make plans and handle any situations that arise when dealing with restaurants.\\n\\nSo now that you have a little background, here is what went down. It is my 24th birthday next week and my best friends bday was on 7/18, so we combined parties. I had been to Blockheads before, and I know that they serve quality, inexpensive margaritas in an outdoor setting that I felt would be perfect to pre-game before we got  into the evening. \\n\\nWe had a large group of people, 18 to be exact, and I knew we needed to get there early, so I made everyone hurry after work to get ready and make an 8 o&#39;clock train so we could get to Blockheads relatively early.  We ended up getting there sometime around 9:30 pm, and it being a clear night out, the place was packed as usual. I spoke with whom I thought was the hostess but turned out to be the manager, Sonya. \\n\\nI was informed &#34;It would be an hour wait, however some of your group is too intoxicated to be served alcohol.&#34; \\n\\nNow, I am a reasonable person, and as I previously mentioned, I have been around restaurants all my life. if somebody in my group was intoxicated to the point of not being served, I would have been the first to admit it and if they complained or made a scene, I would told them they are out of luck and should have been more responsible about what they drank. This however was not the case. Not a single person in my group of 18 was drowsy, loud, obnoxious, unbalanced, sick, slurring or any of the other ques that would be used to determine they are&#34;too drunk&#34;. \\n\\nI spoke with Sonya for several more minutes, attempting to persuade her to change her mind and asking her to tell me what she used to determine they were too drink and who exactly they were in our group, neither of which she would answer. \\n\\nTo my dismay, we made no progress. I took her name and the owners contact information and left dissatisfied. At this point everyone&#39;s buzz that we had worked up on our train ride in was subsiding and people were getting anxious and hungry. So, we decided to go across the court yard and get a bite to eat instead.\\n\\nBefore I was even able to open my mouth to address the host, I was told &#34;I&#39;m sorry sir, we&#39;ve been informed by the other restaurant that some of your group are too intoxicated, and we are unable to server you.&#34;\\n\\nSo we left. Hungry, sober and pretty pissed off. Thank you Blockheads for putting a damper on the rest of the night.\\n\\nWe walked over to the second location that I had planned for the night, The Press Lounge, which is a much more classy, roof-top bar. All 18 people got in without as much as a second glance from the bouncer. After about an hour, we went down town to the Sullivan room, which again, after continuing to drink for another hour, all 18 people got in without issue. \\n\\nI will not be returning to any of the Blockheads establishments, and plan to turn anyone away who mentions that name.\\n\\nFor you Yelp readers, just know that going here will be a roulette of whether or not you get in.', 'label': 0.0}, {'text': u'Hooray!

And I know they were actively avoiding phone calls because every time I called there was a busy signal, meaning they took the phone off the hook, and the second I called when there was none, it would ring for a solid 10 minutes, and then immediately go back to busy signal. \\nI don&#39;t understand how any business that wants to retain any sort of clientele would work in such a manner.\\nI also realized shortly after this, that this Luigi&#39;s is owned by the same mediocre-to-awful Luigi&#39;s that I reviewed a week ago!

I will most CERTAINLY be ordering from elsewhere, and advise that you do the same.\\n\\nTheir ignoring of my phone calls is frustrating, and the longer they ignore, the longer my frustration grows, because you know what - when you mess up an order - especially one that a customer has already paid for - it&#39;s your responsibility as a conscientious restaurant - to make sure that customer gets said order - even if they order an hour before your closing time, and it takes you an hour to deliver it, leaving them less than a minute to call you back to complain about the order you messed up. And if it&#39;s an inconvenience to you to remain open for a few mins. longer when you&#39;ve messed up someone else&#39;s order, then that&#39;s something you should deal with.

Then he came back to the woman with the child a and told her to leave. My jaw DROPPED. I am in dismay for this poor woman and her BABY. What a way to treat a customer. No way am I ever coming back to this whole foods. I am disgraced that I&#39;ve spent so much time and money here since they have opened. My heart really goes out to that woman. I am so disgusted by this matter. I wanted to say something and I now regret not although I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t have mattered. To the woman who took the spoon out of the mothers hand---you should be ashamed of yourself.  What is wrong with you!!!!  What a sick thing to do! I feel nauseous thinking about it. He whole scene makes me sick to my stomach. To the whole foods employee. YOU should be ashamed of yourself. To the young mother. I hope I see you again in the neighborhood. I personally will never shop here anymore. I am quite sickened by this. I will personally pay to have your groceries delivered from another whole foods for you. Being asked to leave was a favor. They really did you a favor and I will not set foot back in and I hope I never see you set foot. I can tell you and your child are both a blessing and this other woman clearly was a hater towards your beauty. I really hope I see you again. Please don&#39;t go back there. It really was a favor having you leave. Everything is a blessing in disguise. I wish you and your family the best blessings and I do hope to see you again.  This whole foods is bad business.

The service was stellar, however, the Atlantic salmon entree was bland and the rest of the courses were unexceptional. To make matters worse, a few hours after leaving, I realized I had a case of food poisoning! This is really unforgivable from what should be a true NY establishment dedicated to excellence.\\n\\nI am scheduled to be celebrating a birthday there next week and debating whether I should warn my party to consider revising the location. Lack of flavor is forgivable, but \\nfood-poisoning is a sanitary issue!', 'label': 1.0}, {'text': u'I&#39;ve been dying to try this place since it first opened when I was a penny pinching Architorture student. Now that I&#39;m a struggling designer I thought lets give it a go nearly a decade later during Restaurant Week. Unfortunately when we turned up for dinner our waiter informed us that they only do a special at lunch and they offer the lunch Bento box all year around so it&#39;s bullshit anyway. Okay so we hunkered down for dinner next to a lovely couple visiting NYC for 24hours. We got to know them quite intimately since our tables were practically on top of each other the spacing was so cramped. The Tadao Ando designed space holds up pretty well, at least the concrete columns do. The undulating ribbon ceiling is starting to fray around the edges. The walls are pretty, pretty filthy and dusty that is and there is a wall made of plastic bottles. I&#39;ve heard a lot about the bathroom, it is extravagant and so over spec&#39;d it only seems useful if your going taking a shit. I imagine they hope their food is of a quality high enough that their patrons aren&#39;t running to take a dump during their meals. Who goes to Morimoto to take a shit?  The toilet is more imaginative than the menu which is tired and boring. When you come with an Australian and they see an Aussie Wagyu Steak for nearly $100 and piss themselves laughing you realise why they have such a fancy bidet. We ordered the Surf &amp; Turf and the recommended Braised Cod. The food was cooked well but the dishes are disappointing especially below quality, presence and imagination for the price. The minuscule bite size amount of steak was typical, mushy mix of avocado and sashimi and lilliputian potatoes. The sauce for the braised cod was too sickly sweet as was the super sweet cocktail which tasted like what we call &#34;lolly&#34; (candy) water. Our waiter was above average but you would have to be given how much they have to overcompensate for. Maybe its just one of those places where you have to walk in without any expectations because you should expect nothing of this menu.', 'label': 0.0}, {'text': u'Was super excited to try this place for Restaurant Week. We had 7pm reservations for a Friday night, which were shockingly easy to get for 2. It&#39;s very a large space so it doesn&#39;t have much atmosphere in the way you would expect from a NY restaurant, but it was never overly loud where we were seated. It&#39;s definitely very pricey, but if you can afford it, I think it&#39;s worth it. We tried almost everything on the menu. The uovo raviolo was absolutely sublime. It has a nice heady truffle flavor and the yolk just melted out. My boyfriend said his lobster wasn&#39;t terribly impressive, but he&#39;s from a coastal town. The beef cheeks entree and the veal were delicious though. The beef cheeks were perfectly tender and would make a great winter dish - they may have been a bit heavy for summer but I still loved it. The char on the veal was perfect. It tasted like summer should be. Beautifully charred and tender. They accidentally screwed up our dessert order but it worked out in our favor since we got to try all the desserts on offer. Their gelatos are actually more like ice cream (not as creamy as gelato usually is) and chocolate was pretty bland, but the vanilla had this great almost herbal/floral flavor to it that I found really unique. The Bhaba al rhum was sticky on the outside and sickly sweet and yet somehow dry on the interior. The whipped cream looked like it came from a can. Would totally pass on that one. But the panacotta was a dream. It had just enough structure to give it some tooth but was still delightfully creamy and over the top. It has definitely inspired me to make my own at home.

She starts inventing rules on the spot, like that you can only get a 3 roll special when dining in - when it&#39;s not said anywhere in the menu or in restaurant, and we ordered it to go or to be delivered several times and never had an issue. I asked to have fried banana dessert to go (comes with a bit of green tea ice cream), she refused - because ice cream may melt! I asked why is it any business of hers if I want to eat my dessert outside, she said what if I go home, put melted dessert in the freezer, eat it then, and get food poisoning and return to complain? OK, so I am complaining here about her lack of service or basic customer service skills; don&#39;t see how it is better. If they have such a strict policy (which I doubt) of no ice cream to go, why not offer to make just the fried bananas to go? I would&#39;ve agreed, since you can get green tea ice cream in a store next door, and they don&#39;t care what happens to your food after it&#39;s paid for.

They were spicy and tangy, and most important the ingredients were fresh and meat cooked very well.  Its not a traditional Baja style taco, it is creative with drizzle of house special sauces.

At first glance the place seems nice. The waiter greeted us and was friendly. After being seated we quickly asked us if we would like to order drinks. He then recommended some apps to us. We decided to order the Fried Calamari (big mistake!) and rack of ribs. My friends ordered a filet sandwich, hot pinwheel sausage and a cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. I decided to order a chili dog without cheese and a Philly cheese steak. \\n\\nWhen our order finally arrive, which did take that long. Honestly, if and I mean &#34;IF&#34; the food was great, the wait would be worth it. This was not one of those situations. So our calamari arrives and I can see the disappointment in my friends eye as well as mine. It looks like something you can easily buy from the freezer of a market. It tasted rough and spoiled. Definitely not fresh. One word to describe it was disgusting! \\n\\nWe finally got our entries and they were not presented well. It looks like someone took a jump-shot from the free-throw line and shot an air ball onto the plate. SPLAT!!! It was just messy, over drenched in oil, and most of all, tasted nasty. My chili dog with out cheese had an abundance of cheese and the actual hot dog was no where to be found. Basically, a sloppy joe on a hoagie. My chees steak looked okay as best, compared to the rest of the dishes. But was had absolutely no flavor, overcooked and extremely dry. I asked for hot sauce in my attempt to bring some flavor to my horrible choices in picking his place. But my hotsauce and refill was no where to be found until I asked for it a third time. \\n\\nMy friends order of ribs was also okay at best. No flavor, just burnt. If you want good ribs, go to BLUE SMOKE. The filet sandwich is pretty much a glorified roast beef sandwich with brunt onions smothered on top. The cheeseburger had a weird looking mushroom which was most definitely not fresh. Not even out the can. It seems like it had been sitting out for a long time. It completely oxidized and turned black (wasn&#39;t cooked). The burger was also the size of a McDonald&#39;s hamburger. And I don&#39;t mean a big mac. I mean a happy meal size burger.\\n\\nRight after taking some bites out of our dishes, one of my friends and I felt nausea. Both of us are athletes and take care of our bodies quite well and are also foodies and can usually handle all types of food. Yet this horrendous meal made both of us sick.

My other friend only took a few bites out of his burger and could not force himself to eat such trash, and this guy usually eats fast food.   \\n\\nSo I went to the counter to ask for change for the waiters tip. The manager in his fake Gucci cap was just leaning on a counter on his phone. Once i got his attention he asked how was our meal. I politely asked, &#34;Would you like the honestly truth?&#34; He said yes, so i told him. This was not good. I had higher expectations for this place and I was disappointed at almost everything. He gave me a stare down like, WHO THE YOU THINK YOU ARE? lol and said, &#34;that&#39;s the first time anyone has said that.&#34; He said all his customers love their Philly cheesesteak.

After seeing good reviews I decided to walk over and try it out. After looking at their menu and all the choices of what I like to call comfort food, I decided instead to order a cup of the chicken soup and a club sandwich. The chicken soup was delicious and hot and really hit the spot for a \"hot\" meal item after eating on the go for 6 days. The club sandwich was also very good. The waitress asked which kind of break so I went with basic club fixings of plain white break and turkey with bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo. I asked for a side of mustard and all in all the sandwich made for a nice comfort meal, it was not busy at the time I visited on a Monday and the waitress was very attentive. A gentleman bussing tables kept walking over to refill my water glass and we never had to flag down our waitress since she kept walking by and politely asking if everything was ok.

I still prefer pork based broth, but Totto\\'s advantage is that it was rich and tasty without being overwhelming and making you feel a little sickly afterward. Lastly, the miso ramen ($11) comes with a half boiled egg, which is my ultimate weakness...a little package of savory creamy heaven!\\n\\nNow, on to the not-so-great. First, I ordered the pork topping (the alternative is chicken), which ended up being two small pieces of rubbery pork. They use very lean meat, which they proceed to overcook... Ick! Second, most of the ramen varieties come with only bean sprouts, meat, scallions, and an egg if you\\'re lucky. You have to pay extra for toppings, even the simple ones like nori and corn will set you back an additional dollar per add-on, which I think is kind of tacky. Third, the wait is absolutely egregious.

Maybe that's why the service was so bad, because the server knew she would get tipped anyways.  \\n\\nTo make the story even better, my wife was up all night with food poisoning from the Mahi Mahi.  \\n\\nLong story short, I will never go back to this restaurant and I recommend the same for others.  This neighborhood is desperately in need of better restaurants.  This isn't one of them.\\n\\nADDENDUM: After a bit of research, I determined that it is in fact illegal to add a gratuity to a table of less than 8 people.

They tweeted me back \"yes! No oil\".\\n\\nI was really excited and even tweeted a photo and how it was good.\\n\\nUnfortunately, not long after eating the pop tart I developed a massive migraine and was quite sick.\\n\\nI believe the ingredient I reacted to was the butter spread product they use, that I now know - after researching to pin down what happened, has canola oil, safflower oil and olive oil.\\n\\nWeather it was mixed with soy oil or not - I always avoid all OILS when eating out and I never would eat any food with oil in it because I often will get sick after wards. This is why I specifically asked about oil in the pop tarts. If they had answered me honestly I would not have eaten it.  The ingredients did NOT LIST OIL either. They listed something that I didn\\'t know was a \"butter spread\" because it only listed the product name, not even that it was a butter spread. If they had made it clear what it was, I would not have eaten it. If the product has oils in it, it would be helpful if they listed that - the actual ingredients.\\n\\nThe only thing worse than how sick I am is the complete lack of concern on their part. In fact when I came to the bakery to try and talk to them - a physician who was behind the counter, would not give me a chance to speak. Instead he yelled at me and about pushed me out the door!\\n\\nThen after tweeting the owner I got bad mouthed and bullied by her.\\n\\nIt\\'s very hard to understand how someone who has experienced getting sick from foods they thought would be safe would be so brazen to be nasty to someone who is concerned about the very same thing.

First the place was slammed with ghetto people yelling and putting on a show. I\\'m used to this type of thing since I have lived around here for 6 years. But what caught my eye were the flies that were all over the place. I didn\\'t think much till I got home...\\n\\nWhen I got home, to my horror, I noticed  there were bugs all over my \"food\". Both flies and roaches. I literally got sick in the bag when I saw the abortion that was inside... Thank god I didn\\'t take a bite or I would have fallen into a shock induced coma. The \"chicken\" was so swarmed with bugs that it looked like a prop from the film Beetlejuice.  Seriously, there were 4 or five visible bugs. I wish I took a picture but instinct kicked in and I ran the \"food\" to trash compactor before I thought to take a picture. \\n\\nTaste: So I can\\'t comment on the taste of the food because I don\\'t eat vermin for health reasons.

Thanks to Dig Inn, I now have another one to add to the list.\\n\\nI was stuck at work on a Sunday and was perusing my options.  I had never ordered from here before, and the reviews on here and seamless were good, so I gave them a try.  This is what I got:\\n\\n- Lemon Chicken\\n- Braised Beef \\n- Un-Fried Veggie Rice\\n- Grilled Summer Veggies\\n- String Beans w/ Potatoes\\n- Spinach & Strawberry Salad\\n- Roasted Red Pepper w/ Toasted Almonds (salad dressing)\\n\\nDelivery time was an hour, give or take, and I had to call them -- not okay.  Then, the delivery guy calls me and tells me he is downstairs, so I take the elevator down 40+ flights, walk to the lobby, go outside, and still have to wait for him.  Listen, I get that delivery people don\\'t like to wait for you to stroll down to get your food, but never had I been made to wait that long.\\n\\nAnyway, the bag is soggy because the sauce and heat made the cardboard container damp, which leaked through to the paper bag.  While I was happy my food wasn\\'t in styrofoam, I had to put paper towels down on my desk as a placemat.\\n\\nNow, onto the portions: I had ordered the large plate, with an additional side of meat, for an additional fee.  Is it wrong for me to assume that I would get a large plate of my original order, PLUS a separate side of meat??  Instead, what I got was everything I ordered crammed into one continuous container, with the flavors of thing x melding into the juices of y and z.   Oh, and the container ain\\'t that big to begin with, lemme tell ya.  \"$16+ for this?!  Really??\" I wondered, as I stared at my plate (I really wish I had the container to give you dimensions, but think 3/4 of a macbook air).  Not only that, if I didn\\'t pay extra for the braised beef, I would have gotten that amount in the chicken, no?  I would have rather not paid more for some beef (which was too sweet, anyway), and gotten the same amount of food with just chicken.  (Speaking of which, I was imagining a breaded chicken francese-type dish, but it was just chunks of skinless breast that was soaked in lemon juice.  Not bad, but nothing spectacular.)\\n\\nNow, onto my major problem.  Okay, so fine; I was willing to write the experience off as whatever, since the food was a little better than mediocre, and like I said, my standards for FiDi are low.  HOWEVER, this place made me sick.  Like, literally sick.  Someone in a previous review mentioned they got food poisoning from it, but I chalked it up to a random incident.  WRONG.  Sparing everyone the gross details, I was sick for two days straight with an upset stomach.  I had ordered the dressing to use on a salad later, but ended up tossing it.  \\n\\nOne plus, though.  You could tell they used quality ingredients like they went shopping at the farmer\\'s market (which, reading the above, sounds like an oxymoron, I know).

If you aren't going to honor your reservation, you shouldn't  put that option there. -____-\\n\\nThe first time that this occurred was during the summer before I left for my trip to Asia. I ate the clam cream rice. I shared the rice with my friend because we both weren't that hungry and we just went here to catch up before I left. I ate some of the rice, but half way, my appetite was just gone. After I got home, I felt really sick and started throwing up. \\n\\nToday, I had dinner with some of my friends. I ordered the burger that comes with fries. I only ate like 3/4th of the burger and took out the bottom bun because it was WAY WAY WAY too greasy that my bun was soaked in oil and became soggy. I ate like 3 fries and didn't even finish it. At first, my friends and I were excited to get the green tea molten lava cake because I had it before and it was pretty good, but we all lost our appetite after a while and actually forgot about dessert. Two of my friends got the omurice; one with beef and the other with beef curry (they both barely touched their dish). \\n\\nWhen I got home, I felt extremely sick like I wanted to throw up. After a while, i threw up some of the burger and felt a bit better. My friend that also ate at the same place felt sick as well and threw up some stomach acid. \\n\\nNot only was the food bad, but their service was pretty bad as well. Someone ordered soda and never got it, but they charged us for it on the bill (ended it taking it off because we told them), we had to ask three times for them to refill our water. We were a pretty large group, so after we payed, two of the workers stood at the opening (since we were sitting in the back) and kept glaring at us. I don't understand why they wanted us to leave so badly because it was obvious no more customers were coming in. \\n\\nOverall, the food here is ehhhhh and really greasy, they have a C rating, so I guess that's why I kept feeling sick, and their service is pretty bad.

Sure they had a month left before they expired, but I have no interest in Low Fat cheese. Walked to the back, picked out six Portugese rolls for fifty five cents. At least I knew why I was buying those, they slice open real easy and make a nice sandwich for my two teenagers. Went home with forty two ounces of brand name, slightly bland cheese and six nice fresh sandwich rolls for under seven dollars. That is what East Village Cheese is, a place where you can buy food so cheaply you wonder if the staff goes out on a shoplifting binge every morning before opening the shop. I assume the inexpensive cheese is either flavors that didn't work out or cheese that Food Emporium didn't need anymore of. It's never made anyone in our family sick but we eat it fairly quickly after purchasing it. As to buying cheese that they actually slice, well that's a little more dicey. Consume it quickly.

(I know.) I was initially a bit afraid of the restaurant choice but let me say, IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!\\n\\nLove the ambiance--it\\'s extremely refreshing! Amidst the chaos of shoppers, piles and racks of clothing, and--did I mention--shoppers. No really, tourist shoppers who blindly veer into walkways while looking in every direction but the right one. It\\'s like being in Times Square where they are all looking up and drifting as they walk and, if you\\'re really lucky, stopping out of nowhere. THAT (that = hellish chaos).\\n\\nAnd then, whew, air, breathing, it\\'s not a mirage--Stella 34 Trattoria.\\n\\nAlready worlds happier than seconds before, the night\\'s experience continued to climb up and up.\\n\\nTo start, we had a few vegetable small plates to share. Not only were they super delicious but they were presented beautifully.\\n\\nThe plating of the food stayed much in the theme of the restaurant, there was a lot of white with vibrant pops of color. The white dishes emphasize the rich color combinations within the dishes, each one looking exciting and enticing--you just have to dive in!\\n\\nOnce you do dive in, it\\'s incredibly flavorful. Clean and flavorful. By clean, I mean every ingredient stands out in the right way--with purpose. It\\'s impressive.\\n\\nThe dining experience at Stella 34 Trattoria quickly turns from pure enjoyment to curiosity over every item on the menu. Each item that we ordered was so good it made me want to try all of those dishes that I ruled out in the decision making process. (I suppose that\\'s what brings people back to a restaurant. But in the moment I felt like a four-year-old having a tantrum because I want to eat more than I know I am capable of and would result in getting sick. I literally almost ordered a pizza after finishing my meal because my grandmother\\'s looked so delicious.)\\n\\nBeyond my obsession with the food plating, style, flavors, and overall deliciousness, is the service. THE SERVICE IS REMARKABLE. From the moment I entered the restaurant and was greeted, I knew I was in for a proper evening.\\n\\nYou see, I was offered a table before the rest of my party arrived. I was also given the option of enjoying a drink at the bar, or relaxing in the large lounge. When two more members of my party arrived, they were directed to the lounge--\"there is a pretty girl waiting for you in the lounge\"--I believe that she made a note of my location in her system. (fabulous service and compliment--too sweet!)\\n\\nWonderfully, that type of service extended to our waitress Sam. She was truly fabulous and extremely knowledgeable of the menu. She was able to have fun with us in a completely professional manner which only added to the exceptional experience that we had at Stella 34 Trattoria.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s dessert (yes, I\\'m back on the food. And while I\\'m there, my \"Tortino Di Melanzane\" was excellent. I want it again right now as I drool over the photo I took of it). THE DESSERT IS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DINNER! It\\'s composed and thoughtful--just look at those textures, yum.\\n\\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BEING TOO PREPARED--AND STELLA 34 TRATTORIA OBVIOUSLY KNOWS IT! Shopped too long and don\\'t have time to cook for the family? Just don\\'t feel like sitting down to a meal? Like a moth to a flame got pulled towards the lit display case filled with deliciousness?\\n\\nYes, they have it all! Not only do they have a prepared food section--I know, \"not only\"--but they have a gelato counter, too. Amazing. Take it all with you--no fuss, no muss. What a perfectly thought out experience!

Unless you're a wuss.\\n\\nRock shrimp (crispy shrimp in house spicy mayonnaise): I expected this to be good. I thought it would be your typical breaded shrimp with spicy mayo sauce. Sounds good to me. After seeing it for the first time, I questioned that notion. Upon tasting it, I knew I was right. The mixture of the crispy orange coating (don't let that turn you off!), mayo and shrimpy taste couldn't be more awesome. \\n\\nI also got vanilla mochi ice cream but I haven't tried that yet.

It is near impossible to find egg bagels in Manhattan so I thought my prayers had finally been answered. \\n\\nBoy, was I wrong. \\n\\nAfter multiple deliveries, and multiple chances, I have officially started a personal boycott against this Long Island chain. \\n\\nReason 1: The delivery men are horribly inappropriate, having attempted very forward, un-wanted and un-warranted sexual advances on both my sister and myself. After calling the Long Island Bagel Cafe to complain about this incident, and my incorrect order, THEY SENT THE SAME MAN YET AGAIN. I find this not only disrespectful and revolting but also a complete lack of sense. As a woman living alone in NYC, this is outrageous. \\n\\nReason 2: I have to assume that the workers here have the literacy levels of a 1st grader- and that might even be saying a lot. I have never ordered from the Long Island Bagel Cafe and received what I ordered. Most of my orders have been online, how my order can still be incorrect when it is sitting there, printed out is beyond me. And never once, throughout all of my horrid experiences was I ever offered a discount on my terrible meal.\\n\\nReason 3: The food, apart from the bagels, is horrendous. I made the mistake of ordering a sandwich, not once, but three times to give the Long Island Bagel Cafe a chance. The croissants where sopping wet and soggy, falling apart as soon it was touched. The meat was old and everything inside the sandwich was wet. It certainly wasn't the honey mustard that I had ordered either.

I\\'ve seen Doyle\\'s bar and walked by it now for almost a year and a half at this point...since July when my boyfriend moved up the block from this bar. \\n\\nIt looks like a regular, Irish pub from the outside - charming, yet being a Manhattan native I\\'ve seen my share of Irish pubs and each time I walked by I wanted to hop in, but didn\\'t because well...no real reason, but with so many bars in the area we just never made it in here.\\n\\nLast Friday I went to my beau\\'s apartment from work, he wasn\\'t home as he was doing laundry to prepare for his bestie from CT who was visiting and staying over the next day. We went in the direction of the Laundromat but realized we had 35-40 minutes to kill. He was flushed, a little clammy and not feeling so great. Wasn\\'t entirely sure whether or not he had a fever, but definitely sure he was a little sick or coming down with something. \\n\\nHe wanted a Hot Toddy and felt it would help make him feel better. I wanted an ice cold beer as I had a rough week, so I suggested Doyle\\'s since it\\'s on the corner and right by his Laundromat. SO HAPPY I did. This charming pub has many redeeming qualities:\\n\\n1.) Newly remodeled - I had never seen the inside before so I honestly can\\'t speak as to what it was like before, but now it\\'s got comfy booths, dim sexy lighting (not too dark, just right!), simple/minimalistic light fixtures give it a nice, classy pub feel - was totally surprised as the outside (in my opinion) doesn\\'t match the inside, this isn\\'t a bad thing - just an observation.\\n\\n2.) Bathrooms - Yes, this is a QUALITY. People go to bars to drink, drinks make us want to tinkle. Being able to tinkle in a clean bathroom is all too often a luxury at a bar. I literally stopped in my tracks when I entered a clean smelling bathroom with a squeaky clean new steel sink & faucet, clean toilets, perfectly kept stalls, no graffiti or etchings...it was amazing. One of the cleanest bathrooms I\\'ve ever seen at a bar. Awesome.\\n\\n3.) Prices - Food menu is your average Irish bar foods, but everything sounds pretty delicious and I\\'ve heard that the Irish Nachos here are to die for. I\\'ll definitely check them out next time I\\'m here. My boy\\'s Hot Toddy (and other cocktails) are $6 (not awful, especially when it\\'s heavy handed and well made). Jameson on the rocks is $6 and beers on draft (imported and domestic) are $6 all day, every day and I was really impressed to see Blue Moon\\'s Agave Nectar on tap here along with Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier (a Hefeweizen style beer brewed by Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan in Freising, German) which I totally got my boyfriend into. He described it as \"oooh, that\\'s refreshing!\" and he\\'s right. Not many Irish bars have a spectacular draft beer selection, kudos Doyle\\'s :).\\n\\n4.) Friendly Bartender - Friday night the man in charge of the bar was Brendan. Brendan is friendly a hoot and gave me a generous sample of Blue Moon\\'s Agave Nectar in a pretty crystal class. He also makes a MEAN Hot Toddy. If I remember correctly he also had a light Irish accent.

Long story short, I eagerly came in and left with frustration and my stomach turned upside down.  I was actually planning to come here for ages and it was much anticipated and I was also so excited to come here today and then... \\n\\nSo when I came there was no wait and it was pretty empty since it was the middle of the day (there were like 6 tables maybe?).  The hostess sat my bf and I down and I asked if we can sit near the place with the long couches instead of in the middle where the tables are smaller and my bf and I wanted to sit next to each other.  However, she told me they were going through shift change so I understood and said ok and sat down where she told me to.  Then, a couple of minutes later (less than 5) she sat 2 guys down where my bf and I wanted to sit.  The terrible experience started from here.  We waited about 15 minutes and we still had no one to bring us water or take our order or anything.  We saw that the table that sat down after us in the seats that we wanted get their water and order their food before the waitress even came to our table.  LIKE HELLO WE WERE HERE FIRST... During the time, we tried to waive down 2 waiters and one did not respond and one said he will get the waitress responsible for our table and our waitress didn't come for another like 10 minutes.  Finally after a 20 minute wait we finally got to order and finally got some water after she left and put our order in.  It was quick for the food to come we just ordered thin fries with a truffle burger to share because I had a snack before coming since my bf gets off late.  I thought we were supposed to get dipping sauces with our fries, however when we asked the waiter for some sauce he only brought us some ketchup.  At this point I was beyond disappointed.\\n\\nNow for the taste of the food I give it probably a 3 (and its averaged from my bf giving the food a 3.5/5 and 4 max).  We both agreed that the truffle burger was good - very flavorful (but he had higher ratings, maybe because he was starving?)  I personally thought that the truffle sauce was a bit too greasy.  Though I did like the flavor, I was not fond of the grease and the meat itself was not really top quality (you can tell from the texture).  The thin fries were bland (maybe because I was upset about the sauce).  But, I did like the crunchy texture and thinness that it possessed.\\n\\nAfter the experience here I have to say, customer service is the most important part of any experience, whether it be dining or a stay at the hotel or a spa.  For me, I'm not sure if the customer service was what killed the taste of all the food for me and made me feel that the money spent was wasted because I just felt so sick while eating there and after I ate there I still felt an upset stomach and plenty of frustration.  Don't get me wrong, the staff weren't NOT friendly, but I don't think they are very helpful.  Maybe this establishment lacks efficient customer service?  But, for a brand that is so well developed and well-known I would expect a lot more.  Now would I recommend my friends to come here?  Probably a Maybe Go if they were dying to try it.  But, if they have never even heard of this place and asked me where to go for a good burger bite around the city?  This place would not be on my list.  Would I ever come back here?  Probably a maybe, but I highly doubt it.  There are plenty of other burger joint gems around so why would I choose to come to a place that leaves me feeling negative and the meal leaves my stomach feeling sick?\", 'label': 0.0}, {'text': u'Oh, well!.. Where to start? My BF and I were at this place twice: honest to god - NEVER AGAIN! There are more good restaurants in the area and 1000s more in all of NYC! \\nWhy did we go there twice you would ask?- because first impression was actually good - the day was bright and sunny, to have brunch outdoors on a crisp fall Saturday morning seemed a great idea - so, why not to try this new, so much talked about, and so much anticipated in the area restaurant. So we got there, set at the outside table - ordered virgin Bloody Mary (nicely balanced and spicy!), grapefruit juice, I got eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and my BF got scrambled eggs with cheddar biscuits and gravy. And both dishes were perfect!! Just yum. And our waitress was nice and helpful. Plus they had a live jazz band! Awesome! So, we were happy and knew we gonna come back for more! - For greater experience, for a delicious dinner and cosy atmosphere! Oh, we were wrong!!!! Jeez..!\\nLet me tell you, tonight we went back for a dinner and had a horrible! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! So we got the table for two of us inside, waiter came to us shortly after, gave us menus and asked if we want anything to drink - of course I got that virgin Bloody Mary (and yes it was good! And spicy). This time we saw the dinner menu first time (definitely not the most creative one - seems like they just got a bunch of different dishes from the menus of other restaurants together) - nothing striking there. Oh well, we ordered anyways and thought we never could go wrong with the \"staples\": mussels, and shrimp ceviche for starters, and lobster bisque for my main with the side of saut\\xe9ed spinach, and beef short ribs with bourbon au jus for my BF\\'s main. At first, waiter came back and said the ceviche isn\\'t available. Then about 10 min later mussels arrived. Cold. Room temperature cold. With a piece of stale bread. We asked for some more bread (maybe hoping for the fresh one). Guy, who brought us food, - said he\\'ll bring some more. And he never did. And we asked our waiter and he never brought it either. Ok. So to the taste of those mussels - I found it fair. My BF said he found couple of pieces too fishy (now he is actually sick and had to take medicine to calm his stomach ache). Then.. The entries arrived. in the middle of the first course.. His plate first. Couple of minutes later mine. I found it bizarre. They didn\\'t give us even 10 minutes to enjoy our so-so mussels and now, when my BF is sick, I\\'m actually thinking thank god we didn\\'t finish them!!! No joke! Ok. To the entries - ribs were ok. Not great but ok. To fatty though. My soup (oh boy!) was not really edible. This lobster bisque had so many pieces of shell in it, it seemed like the poor lobster was mashed with the shell together in the broth! If I\\'ll be able post the pics - check it out for the reference ;) and spinach was extremely garlicky, even for me(!) - who loves garlic in everything, except desert of course :)). To be fair, I had to say, that manager came to Us to ask how we are doing. And when she heard from me that soup is inedible and saw all the pieces of shell, she admitted - it was not a soup it supposed to be! And offered to bring me another bowl. But what the sense?? It still would be the same soup! But she never offered to take it of the check or to buy a drink or desert. None. We had to ask our waiter to take it of the bill since I never ate even a half of it. And he wen to the manager and he did take it of the bill. Thanks. He was apologetic about the our dining experience. \\nIn the conclusion: 2 courses and 2 very unhappy and feeling sick ppl later, I can say: virgin Bloody Mary is good, decor of the place is nice, Comfy sitting, Many TVs for the sport fans.

I\\'ve always been a crazy fan of sushi, going to different restaurants to sample and explore the amazing different rolls of sushi. Never have I sat down at an \"all you can eat\" sushi buffet and spot it empty. I have stepped inside this sushi place twice; once to pick up a menu and once to actually sit down and try their AYCE; both times only had either one customer or none. Worst way to waste 20$ is to go to this place.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the positive:\\n- The place is clean and small; plates are cute and the furniture is decorative.\\n- Lunch AYCE is 11.99 while Dinner is 16.99. This is a dollar cheaper than Sake (which is pretty much the best known sushi buffet around bensonhurst)\\n- Menu is not that small; it has the basic rolls and appetizers.\\n- Appetizers such as the crab rangoon, which is abundant in fillings, and the fried calamari is delish. But the appetizers totally had us fooled about the sushi.\\n\\nNegatives:\\n- Bland! Most of these things were very bland. The rolls were not horribly made, but the taste of them! I\\'ve never ate a sweet potato roll that was not sweet at all!\\n- Other appetizers i hated: Dry kani salad, bland chicken tempura, semi-burnt chicken katsu, Lumpy spicy tuna salad (served with a few slices of avocado)\\n- The best thing about sushi buffet is their unlimited sashimi. Well I could hardly eat it because it was so sluggish and slimy.. I dreaded eating another piece! I felt like I would get some sort of poisoning from this place, but I don\\'t want to be charged for it. The salmon sashimi, especially, was shapeless and poorly cut thin. FYI I ordered about 6 sashimi and flinched at the first one.\\n- ATMOSPHERE? During the daytime, it is bright. During the nighttime, it is bright. There is no romantic feeling, thus bringing a date here would be foolish. The (one) TV played a chinese acrobatic show that slowed my mood down even more. \\n- CUSTOMER SERVICE? Had there been a good waitress, I would perhaps give it a 2/5. Yet the waitress was the only one working in the front with the chef. She hardly says anything, no smiles, no nothing. She and the sushi chef constantly returned to the back to the restaurant, leaving us to feel like the only ones there. (we were technically the only ones there except for another couple). But it made me wonder how long it would take them to realize if someone were to dine-and-ditch.

At the time, there weren\\'t a lot of people loitering outside, so we walked down the street to this bodega to pick up some beers to share as it\\'s BYOB. Got back and there was a HUGE gathering outside with people on each step of the narrow staircase but luckily one of the guys spotted us and noticed it was just the two of us (we can make it if we try... -- sorry had to) and we squeezed up the tight stairway and was transported into this crazy lighted space. \\n\\nWarning. This place is SMALL. like REALLY REALLY SMALL. If you\\'ve ever ridden on a yellow school bus when you were primary/secondary school, this space is exactly like the inside of a school bus on steroids. I mean, close quarters and low ceilings, enhanced by the fact that the amazing lights are hung incredibly low. I\\'m 5\\'1\" and I felt a few lights on the top of my head.\\n\\nThis place can get incredibly loud, especially when you\\'ve got like 4 birthday parties within one meal time session. And each time they play this awesome (for the first couple of times) birthday song with the strobe light effects, but it gets old after about the 4th time. I\\'m certain the workers are all sick of it by now, haha. \\n\\nWe ordered the chicken tikka masala and the chana shag (chickpea and spinach) and both dishes were okay. They weren\\'t anything to write home about -- and I have really high standards for Indian dishes ever since I got a taste of real home cooking -- but they were good decent plates, and I had been craving Indian food so it probably tasted even better than it actually was but I digress. Food came out hot and yummy. The naan wasn\\'t bad either, but I\\'ve had better vegetable samosas. I think it was just like potato and curry in it and nothing else. The mango ice cream was yummy too. Just a hint of mango and made for a nice \"palate cleanser\" I guess, and it was free, soooo that makes it even better. \\n\\nAnother thing that we didn\\'t know about, it\\'s a cash only place. So remember to bring cash!\\n\\nSo I give it 3.5 stars for the atmosphere -- the fact that people around us all seemed like they were having an amazing time (probably all the hard liquor we saw at some tables), the trippyness, and the food was okay.

I received an invitation from Sarah to come and try out their pizza. NYCTalking.com was out to represent y'all! Anyone that knows me knows that I love pizza, I mean I really love pizza. Some websites will ask the question what would be the last meal you would like to eat before you die, my answer is always pizza.\\n\\nSo naturally when Sarah invited me over there was no question that I was going to come and try out this pizza. The short train ride and the brief walk were well worth it. When I arrived, Sarah offered me a drink and she began to tell me about the company. She told me a lot of things, some of which I don't remember, but one of the main items that I do remember is the story behind the tomatoes. Sarah told me that the tomatoes are imported from Italy, she said that they come from a place close to Mount Vesuvius. She was very proud in telling me that the only component in the sauce was these tomatoes. There are no added salt's or other condiments in this sauce. You can really taste the difference I have to say. Sarah was also very excited to tell me about the truck and how it is environmentally safe. In addition to this the boxes that they provide for take-out are also 100% biodegradable, and they provide recycle bins for your convenience.\\n\\nEnough about that though, let's talk about what we all came to talk about, the pizza. I have to tell you for pizza that was prepared in under 90 seconds, in a specially made 900 degree oven, in a truck, in the middle of a street in Midtown, this was really, really good pizza.\\n\\nThere are two ways that I judge a pizza, the first way that I judge a pizza is whether or not I can taste all of the individual components. While I'm eating the pizza I taste for the sauce, I taste for the cheese, and I taste for the dough. If I can break down each of those components in my mouth as I'm eating it, if I can separate them and tell the difference, then that my friends is good pizza. The other way I can tell whether or not a pizza is good is to determine if eating it gives me a headache. I suffer from high blood pressure and I get migraine headaches. Due to this I cannot eat pizza on a regular basis because it will make me sick. But that doesn't change the fact that pizza is by far my favorite food in the world.\\n\\nOne of my favorite pizza pies comes from a place called Goodfellas LES. All things considered this pie was comparable with my favorite pie. The pizza comes out of the oven very hot so do be careful about burning your mouth. Give it a few moments to cool down and then sink your teeth into the deliciousness that is a Neapolitan express pizza pie.\\n\\nThe truck doesn't come out to the Wall Street area downtown, however if I am ever in the Midtown area or the Meatpacking district when they are around and I see the truck I will stop by for a pie because it was really, really good. I recommend that you guys try out their pizza pie at least once, and then let me know what you think.

Make sure you don\\'t just pop the dumpling into your mouth whole otherwise you will scorch yourself!\\n\\nI also enjoy the crispy dough, the salt soy bean milk, the dumplings in peanut sauce, the spicy beef tripe salad and the crispy noodles.  The staff are friendly and they always remember us and know what we want.  The restaurant has recently expanded, so they have three adjacent seating areas and can accommodate large parties.  They are also open early and close late, so you can go whenever you have a craving for soup dumplings.  \\n\\nMost important to me, as my friends know, is hygiene.

Every 10-15 minutes, a waitress will stop by to change your charred grill and replace it with a new one.

Some of the fish was okay - the tuna, however, was brown, wrinkled and tough, and the tamago (sweet egg) was also brown. It was obviously not only not fresh, but old enough that it should not have been served. We left those pieces on our plates and when our waitress cleared the table, she asked why we didn't eat them. My boyfriend paused for a moment and then told her it was because they were clearly old. She told us that she was going to tell the chef and manager but did not apologize or say anything else. We gave her our card to pay, and shortly after signing for the first check, they brought back a second because they had left a drink off of the initial bill. We paid for that too, all without complaint, and when our card was run for the second bill, the manager (instead of the waitress) brought it back and basically dropped it on the table without saying a word or looking at us. To compare - on our way in, he shook my boyfriend's hand, patted him on the back and walked us to a table. During previous visits, we have had 20 minute long conversations with multiple staff members, many of whom made it a point to stop by our table whenever we visited, even if we weren't seated in their area. On our walk out of the restaurant, after setting aside the old items on our plates and not causing a scene, complaining loudly, asking for a refund, or anything, some of the same employees gave us dirty looks or ignored us.\\n\\nFor that that amount of rudeness, maybe we should have made a huge stink about it. To top it off, my boyfriend spent the entire night sick to his stomach. We will absolutely not be back.\", 'label': 1.0}, {'text': u'As natural as they claim to be, their food made me sick.

This is not to say that I am any sort of vampire; I simply have yet to be in the vicinity of Clemen's before dark.  However, no trip to the area is complete without a visit to this tortilla filled Valhalla!\\n\\nAll of their food is excellent and flavorful, and appears to be fresh as well.

Clemen's has provided me two of those four things, and for that, I am endlessly thankful.\\n\\nIt's also a rather relaxed environment, and often, after a night of drinking, I will come here to write while consuming vast amounts of tacos.  In addition to their amazing meats, they have some of the most delicious jalapenos I have ever tasted, and I will sometimes order nothing more than a large jar of those to snack on, slowly devouring their spicy goodness as I write.  Their staff is also quite respectful, and have treated my inebriated self with as much respect as they have whilst I was sober.  I love them, and were I woman I would gladly throw myself at their feet and beg them to make me their burrito queen by way of marriage.

Coming from Chicago I suppose my standards are high, but even for New York marble is at the bottom. The only reason for two stars is because it\\'s very pretty. Has a great atmosphere. Although the night I was there they were taking photographs and kept changing the lighting which was slightly annoying during a Saturday evening dinner. As for the food-- we started with the fried oysters. In edible. Literally. I took one bite and instantly got sick I had to spit it out. Which I can safely say was a complete first for me. I\\'m really not picky so to spit something out meant it was baaaaad. Then I ordered a filet mignon med rare. Nice couldn\\'t wait.

Awesome- I\\'m officially done with marble at this point. But ok, ill try the Mac and cheese because the picture on yelp looked awesome so at the least this has to be good right? Wrong. It was super grainy. I think they use egg in their recipe (largely a Southern thing), which can be good- but in this case left the cheese sauce broken and gross. If it wasn\\'t egg-- then possibly milk that went bad? Either way, not good. So I ask my date are you doing any better? Unfortunately, no. His steak and fries were eh and also cooked improperly. So sad- looked so promising. Worst part is on the way out someone (who I suspected was the chef -- came from the kitchen)... Asked us how our meal was. My date felt bad and said \"great, thanks\"...

They really need to have some type of control and kick people out when it is getting to be too much. The constant screaming, chanting and yelling can get old. There was a drunken Pillsbury doughboy throwing Philadelphia Rolls at a Zombie who was chugging sake out of a bottle that looked like Moonshine. \\n\\nThe food sucked. The rolls were small and didn\\'t taste right. None of the seafood tasted fresh. The beer was shitty tap beer and was warm. The service was pretty good and they were quick; however when you are bringing unwanted shitty food and drinks to the table that resemble trash it defeats the purpose of good service. \\n\\nAs if things couldn\\'t get worse I decided to take a piss in the bathroom in the back. Walking through the sea of drunks was quite difficult. I finally got to the bathroom and it was disgusting. It looked like Hepatitis was created there. There was a large amount of rust and dirt all over. I pushed the lock on the door and regretted it immediately. I said to myself \"GOD DAMMIT THAT DOOR COULD HAVE JUST GAVE ME GHONNORHEA\" I scrubbed my hands thoroughly with boiling hot water and soap. This was a life saver. I then went on to pee and flushed the toilet bowl with my foot to avoid any further possible disease contraction. \\n\\nI do not suggest coming here unless you are with 12 of your boys and want to black out in 2 hours.

I have no idea how these vendors maintain such excellent quality while cooking outside under a tent. \\n\\nPizza Moto - nearly perfect. I tried the white pizza with grilled Brussels sprouts. I think I would have enjoyed a red pie a bit more, but the quality of the crust and the ingredients cannot be beat. They cook on a mobile coal fired oven that maintains a perfectly even 800\\xb0 temperature. They were great guys who were willing to sit around and discuss the moisture content of the dough being the secret to a crispy exterior and chewy interior crust. I loved them and their fabulous pizzas and if I ever have the opportunity I will be back for more. \\n\\nMilk Truck - breakfast grilled cheese sandwich:  this sandwich included two fried eggs, caramelized onions and thick slices of cheddar cheese for a perfectly melted treat. I substituted the rosemary bread for the Rye that the sandwich typically comes on and I'm so glad I did. The rosemary bread had significant flavor on its own but after being brushed with a sick layer of butter and grilled it was amazingly decadent and delicious. The only thing that could have made it better is something vinegary or spicy. I borrowed a spicy mustard from one of my friends meals and added it. Amazing. \\n\\nHandsome Hank's fish and chips: so good it called to me, a vegetarian, to try it. I've never eaten seafood so I'm not sure what type of fish it was but it was large chunks of beautifully battered, crunchy fried fish. The tartar sauce was perfect and even the fries were great. \\n\\nQueen Cobra Thai massaman curry: interesting composition, nice flavors, but not the best food I ate at this market. They start with a layer of mashed potatoes in the bottom of the bowl, then layer on onions and carrots, pour over the curry and top it with shredded coconut and crushed peanuts. The peanuts added a texture that I did not care for, but it was still really good and the roti fried in butter fresh in front of you is awesome. \\n\\nI'm not sure of the vendors' name but two of my friends ate tuna tartare tacos and thought they were the most amazing thing that they'd ever eaten. \\n\\nThe only disappointment of the day for me was the Mexican hot chocolate stand.

If you are a local, then you should already know that prior to Clarke\\'s this place was initially another burger joint called \"GoodBurger\". However GoodBurger was everything but a good burger joint for the simple fact that the service was horrible, slow and the food was mediocre. When GoodBurger closed down to make it\\'s way for this new place Clarke\\'s Standard, my heart beat the tempo of promise. As a matter of fact, the first couple months was excellent! If I did my review a couple months ago, I would have given the place a 5 star just for the simple fact that the place was fully staffed with people who had excellent customer service, quick, friendly and on top of that, the burgers were on point and flavorful! Don\\'t even get me started on the french fries. I had  become an addict, that I had to enter the \"Say No to French Fries Rehab Clinic.\" No lie, it used to take me 5 minutes to get my entire meal and the manager at the time (Anthony) would walk up and down the kitchen to make sure things were running smoothly. \\n\\nFast forward 2 months on hiatus from this place for the simple fact that this place was too addicting. Now I ask this, what the hell happened to this place? Since I last came, the quality of this place just plummeted like the Great Depression stock market! The old manager here transferred to a different location, there is now different staff, the food was horrible and the service was slow! \\n\\nI had ordered my usual burger meal that used to only take 5 minutes on a busy day...and this day it was almost 20 minutes on a slow day and I was still standing waiting for my meal. I walked over to the grill area and there were 2 cooks at the grill. I saw a hispanic girl prepping a burger, and naturally I thought she was prepping mine. But she looked at me and took a huge bite out of the hamburger! What? Did my eyes just see correctly? She was straight eating a hamburger from the grill! The second cook was a guy texting away on his phone with his gloves still on and spatula in hand! Don\\'t believe me, see picture here: http://alturl.com/22q89 Is that even sanitary? I made a complaint to the cashier asking what was taking so long. \\nThe cashier yelled at the cooks, \"she\\'s been standing here for a long time, where\\'s her burger!?\" One of the cooks asked \"what did she order?\" which confirms to me that they never made my order. The girl who was probably eating the hamburger at the grill was probably eating MY order! SMH. Don\\'t they have a break room to eat their food or eat at the table like the rest of the people during their breaks? I don\\'t think she was on her break though because she was in between eating her burger and tending to the fries.\\n\\nSo, I had to wait another few minutes for my burger. I was on my lunch break so my time was limited since I wasted my entire lunch break waiting for my food. By the time I got back to work, I took 1 bite out of my burger just to find it still RAW! I had asked for medium-well done and I got medium-RAW. Picture: http://alturl.com/7mu9j\\nThe lettuce was old and not crisp at all, it had browning spots on it with mushy edges. There was no time for me to take the burger back since my lunch break was over so I threw it out. It was horrible! I barely had any time to finish my fries.

When I got closer to the dish, I realizes that their chicken salad was spoiled.

I\\'d pass by every day, but nothing. Then, on a Thursday I believe, the doors were open. The TVs were on. The beer was flowing. The Pearly Gates had been pushed forth and Heaven awaited. Before seeing this I had convinced my girlfriend to go to the lowly Panera around the corner from us, but upon seeing this event, I decided to burn down the Panera. Thankfully I didn\\'t do that because I do rather like their big kid grilled cheese. \\n\\nWe go expecting the typical fair. Thursday Night football (Ravens vs. Browns yuck) and beer. My girlfriend and I, at the time, were 22 and fresh out of school. We were not the most sophisticated beer drinkers of yet. Walking into Bud\\'s and looking at the menu was like getting a 7th grader a paid subscription to a porn site.  Our hands were shaking. \"21st Prohibition what?\" we said. \"Triple Horse, what\\'s that like?\". \"Stout, Ale, Lager, Amber, oh my.\" We didn\\'t actually say the last one. \\n\\nOur waitress looked like she was fifteen, which usually is a warning sign, but being an occasional optimist, I decided that this time good things were going to come in small packages. She was in fact not a great server, but I couldn\\'t help but feel that we were sharing something truly special. She got us our beers and we drank them and watched the game. We probably had 4 beers, and it was love. We tipped well, we said thank you, and we were on our way. \\n\\nWe went back the next day because we\\'re fat fatties. We got more brews in our bellies and also decided to try the wings. Holy ball sacks, I didn\\'t know what wings could taste like...and that has nothing to do with how stuffy my nose can get when drinking! They were great. On more than one occasion the Sun Sauce wings left me reeling from their flavor and sent me to the toilets early and often. Even the diarrhea was just the right amount of spicy. \\n\\nFor the next year and change we went to Bud\\'s on occasion. Sometimes as much as 4 times a month. We did notice that it had gotten louder, and the crowd more obnoxious and \"suity\", but that didn\\'t matter, Buds was ours. Oh, big shout out to Jacob, who one night stole my heart with his glasses, great service, thankful attitude, and the fact that he looked exactly like me. Also, big ups to the guy who talked to me about my Cactus Jack t-shirt; it made up for the fact you got our order wrong. You were a cool dude. Also, big, big thanks to the man who seemed to seat us every Thursday...you truly were a god among men and the backbone of the establishment and my life. \\n\\nSo a year passes, November comes. My lady and I are slated to move ( we have mice because we\\'re filthy, filthy people). We get a new place in the ultra hip 30th ave region. We actually are moving today. I go on to Yelp to see if Bud\\'s is being renovated, perhaps being made larger. More tv\\'s? More beers? More handsome and beautiful servers? Nope. It\\'s closed. Closed down forever. I feel like my son died, but worse, because my son was an asshole and Bud\\'s was the greatest. \\n\\nBuds, I know you\\'re up there in bar heaven. I take solace in that fact. I don\\'t believe in people heaven, but I do believe in Bar Heaven and Dog Heaven. I hope you\\'re happy up there with your Triple Horses and your Cannonball Sauce, because you deserve it. You made dinner great for my girlfriend and my friends, and I\\'ll speak of you fondly. \\n\\n- Love, \\nThe Guy Who Always Ordered Sun Sauce Wings and Tipped 20% because I\\'m nice, but let\\'s be real, I\\'m not that nice.', 'label': 0.0}, {'text': u\"Ordered from this restaurant via seamless.

It's fairly standard-tasting caesar salad, which is not a bad thing, and is a nice, lighter refreshing way to start the meal.\\n\\n- Onion & Bone Marrow Soup ($14)\\nThis is a great take on French Onion Soup, with a giant bone filled with marrow stuck in the middle of the bowl. Here's where it starts getting overwhelming, but this was really delicious too.\\n\\n- Bone-in Burger ($15)\\nThis seems to be the thing everyone is talking about, and the thing to get here. It is as bizarre as it sounds - a burger with a giant bone sticking out of it. It's a mess to eat, even once you manage to get the bone out of it. It's kind of like a steak on a bun, since the meat is made of a mix of different high quality and delicious meats. This burger really is incredible and is worth all of the hype you are hearing about or will soon hear about it. It's not just a novelty and something you get just to Instagram a picture of, it really is excellent. \\n\\n- Grass-fed Cowboy Steak ($50)\\nThis is a really delicious steak, but that price tag hurts a bit.

Not that great. I should have just gone with instinct and got more carbs instead of trying to add some silly vegetables to the mix.\\n\\n- Poutine ($10)\\nI also don't really get poutine yet. I've tried it a number of times, and I always wonder why I do it, when after I enjoy a few crispy, not completely soggy and saturated fries, I pretty much get sick of it. Some of the cheese curds were also completely raw, which I don't know if it was the intention, but I didn't quite enjoy. Maybe go with the regular fries next time.\\n\\n- Cinnamon Cake ($11) a la mode (+ $3)\\nDessert is pretty great here. The pastry chef comes around with a dessert cart after you make your selection from a large number of cakes and other options. I kept seeing stuff about this cake, so I figured I should try it, and it did not disappoint. It's not very rich, which is what most people like about it, but I kind of wish I tried the richer sounding Black Forest Cake, since I enjoy sweetness to the point of diabetes. This was really great though, and is a nice choice to end the meal after the overwhelming meat sweats start to set in.\\n\\nThis place is out there, both in concept and location, but I am a fan.

My pepper steak with onions was mostly onions, with only a few pieces of small, fatty, chewy meat. Where's the beef? My sweet and sour pork (yes, I ordered two meals - one for that day, one for the next) was mostly just deep-fried flour and cornstarch. A couple of pieces didn't contain any pork at all. Also, my pork fried rice (which came with each entree) was mostly fried rice, with just a few tiny pieces of pork.

He knew that we were worried sick about Michelle and wanted us to enjoy our dinner. Heirloom tomato gazpacho (zebra tomatoes are green even when ripe) with frozen goat cheese sorbet showcased familiar flavors with unconventional preparation.\\n \\nThe chickpea panisse tasted like a crispy spring roll with a puree of chickpea inside. The savory ham went well with the creamy chickpea.\\n \\nWhen we split the bread apart, billowing wisps of steam gave us a mini-facial.

Suffice it to say that I wear many hats as my firm of 50 people can be described as entrepreneurial by nature, a perfect conduit for me to take on disparate responsibilities and segue in and out of different verticals.

Champagne foam with strawberry sorbet and pannacotta with lemon \"caviar\" (comprised of an agar and lemon reduction).

First of all, I spent $30 on my meal and ended up throwing a good portion of it in the trash, just like the net amount listed on my paycheck.  I work so hard to earn my money and the government comes in and throws a good portion of it in the trash.  What I am left with is small, insignificant, and sad.

I ordered fried tofu, tomago, and the beef teriyaki entree with salad.  \\n\\nI started with the salad.  I ended up picking out some rotten lettuce bits and one piece of bird seed (I have a budgie, so I know what bird seed looks like, and by golly, that was a bird seed in my salad - and no - my budgie did not throw it there when I wasn't looking).  The salad was as unwashed as a cheap and haggard hooker.  It tasted no different than if I went outside and started eating the dirt out of my neighbor's garden.  The ginger dressing was runny and watery...it didn't stick to a single piece of salad.  I ate about 80% of the salad and then I couldn't stomach eating anymore.\\n\\nNext I ate the tomago.  Well, I ate exactly one bite of the tomago.

I opened the container and was in disbelief.  What sat in that container was the nastiest, fattiest piece of leather ever.  I ate two pieces and had to stop.  It was turning to wood in my throat and choking me.  It was then that I noticed that the meat had a green tinge to it!  It was rotten!  I wouldn't have known from the taste of it because my taste buds had already been assaulted with dirt salad and fish scale custard!

It was basically chunks of tofu covered in a soggy, chewy material (I cannot claim this to be any sort of breading...it was muck).

But after eating a burger their 6 year old son wound up in the hospital with severe food poisoning, had to be re-hydrated with an I/V.

It was my second time at the restaurant.  My first time was on a Saturday night with 3 friends, and the place was too packed and loud for my taste.  It is a popular restaurant, and deserves to be, but a low-key Tuesday night experience was more to my liking.\\n\\nFirst, the service was second to none.  Alex, the manager, brought us two glasses of champagne and a pumpkin pie desert on the house.  She was very friendly, professional and genuinely wanted us to have a great experience.  What surprised me was that she didn\\'t seem pressed for time.  We chatted with her for quite a while and enjoyed the conversation.  She came by our table just enough to check up on how we were doing, but not too much that we felt interrupted.  One thing I find annoying in restaurants is when a staff member asks you, right after you\\'ve taken a bite of food, \"how\\'s everything?\" ... and you feel rushed to chew and swallow and answer them.  Alex came by several times and chatted with us, but never were we in that awkward situation. There was a natural and easy flow to the service all night.  \\n\\nOur waiter, who looked like a young Charlie Sheen -- and we told him that and had a laugh about it (he\\'d been told this many times before) -- was really cool too.  Easy going, professional and just a good guy.  The best service is when it\\'s natural, and that\\'s what Alex and Charlie Sheen were all night.  Bad service is when they\\'re trying too hard and it becomes annoying, or when they pay so little attention to you that you end up spending a lot of time looking for them.  \\n\\nAfter discussing the menu with Alex, my friend and I both decided on the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass.  This is just an incredible dish!  The balance of flavors and textures and colors is ... in a word ... perfection.  We were both blown away, and I could see myself coming back over and over and ordering this dish until I got sick of it.  Then I\\'d explore the rest of the menu.  \\n\\nI had mine with a side of Soft Truffle Polenta, which was amazing as well.  Alex suggested this side to me.  I had overlooked it because \"polenta\" doesn\\'t exactly sound exciting.  But she said the truffle in it makes it great, and she was right.  It was a unique and delicious side dish that went perfectly with the Sea Bass.\\n\\nMy friend is Russian, so we ordered two shots of vodka with dinner.  They generously brought us double shots.  Russians do shots in between each course to boost up the appetite, and it really works.  I was sold on vodka shots with dinner, and was glad we didn\\'t bother with wine or beer.  \\n\\nFor desert, we ordered a chocolate cake with walnuts and vanilla ice cream on top that was divine.  Divine!  Like I said, Alex brought us a free pumpkin pie with whipped cream on top.  It was also really good, and a nice Thanksgiving-time desert.\\n\\nOverall, Aquagrill did a superb job on food and service, and I enjoyed sitting in the enclosed patio looking out at Sixth Avenue.  Just a great dinner experience!  \\n\\nI\\'d highly recommend the more chill Tuesday night Aquagrill experience.  I\\'d say the restaurant was 80% full.

About the only thing that differed from my meals (albeit vegetarian) at Sanskriti and my meals in India is the amount of spice.  Sanskriti understandably tones it down as to not shock their customers.  But otherwise this is the type of Indian food that turns the cuisine from a niche pig out meal to something you could conceivably eat every day and feel great, healthy, and not get bored by.  I absolutely love this place and I hope that it stays open for a long long time.  I intend to order more frequently from here just to do my part in trying to make that happen, and I urge you to do the same.\", 'label': 0.0}, {'text': u\"This really small restaurant has the best (real) Mexican tacos in NYC.

I was prepared for a stressful phone call as are most phone calls to restaurants when you want to place an order. Normally the person on the phone isn\\'t very friendly and clearly hates their job, misspells your name or asks you 7 times what your phone number is, and always tries to rush my order making it very clear they want to get off the phone.\\nHowever, I was pleasantly surprised. A girl answered the phone by the name of Clara (I believe that was her name but I could be mistaken). Immediately from the start of the call Clara was extremely friendly and helpful. She talked to me as if I was an old friend, not just some customer bothering her. She gave me suggestions on what to order (which is very hard because I am not only dairy-free but also have a severe gluten allergy), even going so far as to check with the chef to make sure she had given me all the options. This meant a lot to me since a lot of times when I order delivery the person on the phone claims a certain item does not have gluten in it, however it arrives at my apartment, I eat it, and get extremely sick. She reviewed all my information to make sure it was correct but didn\\'t ask over and over again which is something that really bugs me about ordering things over the phone. She did have to put me on hold to answer another call but I was only on hold for a few seconds and when Clara came back on the line she gave an apology that sounded shockingly sincere. \\nWhen I was finished ordering she reviewed my total and thanked me for ordering with STIX. When I received the order there was a little note inside that said \"hey Paul! I hope you love your food. Just so you know I made sure there is no pita included in your order and also that your order did not touch pita since it had gluten in it and I seemed to have forgotten to say that over the phone. Have a great night! ~Clara\" \\nThat kind of customer service is unbeatable. From the way she talked to me on the phone, to her suggestions on what to eat, to the note she wrote to make sure that my food was gluten free....Clara truly made this delivery process much more pleasant than any other delivery I have ever placed. \\nOH! and the food was delicious too!!!

To be fair, the place is open for only 2 months and having come from a restaurant background many moons ago, it\\'s almost impossible to get it right when the doors first open.  Consider that when reading some of the bad reviews and don\\'t be afraid to go here.. it was fantastic!\\n\\nFor starters, the service was fantastic.   Ashley was our waitress and she took amazing care of us.  She was fun and she really knew the menu.  \\n\\nWe went for the true tapas experience.  Started with the avocado and heirloom tomato salads.  Both were very simple, fresh and tasty... as they should have been.   Then on to the main tapas.. Shishitos were exactly the way they should be.. piping hot and a gamble of heat... love them..   Grill asparagus was tender as can be and perfectly seasoned.  Octopus was different but in a great way!   Meatballs were pretty good... probably my least favorite but not bad at all.   Grill calamari was light and tender.   Tuna tataki.. pretty basic top quality tuna.. always a favorite.    The star of the tapas was the Fioe Grais .. i get so exited when I see this on a menu and so let down when it comes to the table as a pate... ugh!!  So frustrating.. Ok.. pate is decent but GIVE ME SEARED LIVER... yum!!!  it was outstanding with the potato pancakes and scallops. If you are a lover of this.. must try it!!   let me not forget the stuffed dates wrapped w/ bacon.. kind of a staple these days at any good \"plates\" place!!  \\n\\n We finished with the Flan which was second best I have ever had.  I can\\'t give it the best because I have a very good friend (Owen) that makes it just a little better (ok.. it might be equal but he\\'s my buddy).  seriously.. it was amazing!  The chef came over and explained how it was made and how it was passed down through the family.   it is way better than your average flan.   The chocolate moose was pretty sick too.   Very rich and smooth but with little pieces of chocolate throughout to add a little texture that was less familiar but really appreciated.  \\n\\nNot sure why people are complaining about the Sangria.. although I have not had it my buddy has been there twice and bragged it is the best he has ever had.   The Taperia Old Fashion was just right for me.     Give me a good lunch buzz too!!  :)\\n\\nlet me finish with the was everything came out.   I hate nothing more than when the food just all comes out randomly and all at once.   Either the sever or the kitchen decided how it was all to come out in stages and they nailed it.   They probably sent it out in 4 to 5 stages.   We truly got to appreciate everything we were eating.   I can\\'t stress how important this is.

So he came over afterward and placed our order. Then things got bad. My congee came pretty quick and each of us had a bowl and there was still more. But then the beef and the sweet and sour pork took another 20-30 mins. I was done eating before they got their food. Ironically, the table that ordered before us, which they had lobsters and all the other rather fancy food that are actually time consuming, was already there. That got us pretty pissed off. Because I honestly don't think beef and pork takes that long to cook. Especially when you're not even busy. But whatever. We ate, got the bill. They even had a little section at the bottom where you can comment on their service. I didn't have anything to write with, or else I would've put horrible. BUT. That wasn't the point. The point was, we gave about 5 dollars tips for less than $40 or $50 of food. And we took off about $1 because of the shitty service. The waiter seriously came running after us and said we didn't give them enough tips. I thought, tips is what customers give you when they are satisfied???

It helps to get to know them, as you\\'ll want ALL questions answered by a pharmacist.  The pharmacy assistants have kind, courteous days and very surly days, but, there\\'s no day when you can trust them for accurate information (Well, there\\'s ONE experienced tech, IF you insist AND she has the time).  \\n\\nWhether it\\'s about medication, insurance, or their OWN records, trivial or vitally important, and even if I ask them to check again, the answers are wrong. It\\'s consistent and serious. \\n\\nBy no means are these bad or stupid people. It\\'s poor management.  The too-small support staff is inadequately trained (I\\'m told the pharmacists are frustrated too). Plus, the way they try to brush off questions is so uniform that they must be directed to do so.  I\\'ve reported the problem to Walgreen\\'s national office--no change.   \\n\\nYet, 111th is my best option now.  Disappointed when they first opened, I\\'d tried other places:  7 years with the dreadful RITE AID on 110th, which boasted 45-minute lines at 2 a.m., terrifying Rx errors, angry staff, and a filthy store teeming with mice, BUT was national and 24/7;  a few decent months with DR on 108 & Amsterdam, except they weren\\'t natn\\'l yet + they\\'d shutter the pharmacy for the day if the pharmacist got sick (!);  5 years with the excellent CVS on 86th & Amsterdam until it became impractical.  Then, after a bad third try at 111th,  I went to Walgreen\\'s on 97th & B\\'way, which delivered evenings and was superbly managed by pharmacist Mr. Nehru (I miss you!). He left big shoes to fill when he was transferred, but it\\'s still pretty good. Then, sniffle!, they stopped delivering to my area (I get it--there are at 5 DRs bet 97th & 111th).\\n\\nAt least now 111th  is 24/7, delivers during the day, and is part of a national chain. This helps me, though I DON\\'T get why it\\'s harder to fill a scrip here than elsewhere. \\n\\nAfter a year\\'s experience, let me share the following survival tactics: \\n\\n\\n1:  Never go there in a hurry.  A simple transaction can wind up resembling an excerpt from Kafka\\'s \"The Trial.\"  You\\'ll get angry AND you\\'ll have to come back again.  Avoid the evening rush (5-7p) when the line is long, there isn\\'t enough staff, it\\'s hard to get pharmacist help, and tempers flare.  Late night is my favorite, early a.m is good. Other times vary. \\n\\n\\n2: The pharmacy assistants will automatically answer \"No, we can\\'t,\" \"No, you can\\'t,\" or \"No, your insurance doesn\\'t\" to any question you ask. (Ahh, you could close your eyes and almost imagine you\\'re in Paris). If they do agree to check into your query, 99% of the time you will get a wrong answer. It\\'s even worse over the phone.  (Like I said, it\\'s bad management.)\\n\\nBeware: even after you know better, your reasonable nature will lull you into thinking, \"Oh, THIS question is simple and common enough for the PAs to answer.\"  As soon as you realize your mistake, try to get hold of yourself.  This is the flash point where so many succumb to flailing, strangulated temper-tantrums.  If you have a sedative, take it. Then proceed to # 3. \\n\\n\\n3:  Thank the P.A.s warmly, then quietly sidle over to the left end of the counter, where you will be within eye- and earshot of the pharmacist.  Smile and wave to let him/her know you\\'re there, then wait with all the patience you can muster, for the pharmacist will be simultaneously:  \\n\\n    (a) FILLING a prescription (maybe yours!); \\n\\n    (b) TRYING not to crack through 30 minutes of awful \"hold music\" and mocking repetitions of \"Your business is important to us...,\" piped at full volume on speakerphone, until an insurance rep comes on for the day\\'s 27th attempt at making sense of deviously complicated Rx plans; \\n\\n    (c) STRAINING to ignore the misinformation being given to customers just 8 feet away, while remaining poised to rush in and intervene before the next, inevitable altercation erupts;\\n\\n    (d)  TURNING back to the pill counter, trying to remember which prescription s/he\\'d been filling, then moving on to the huge stack of scrips still waiting.\\n\\nAs you\\'ve been undeterred, the PAs will now offer to help. Smile and wait.   As soon as the pharmacist is free, you\\'ll get help.  On meds and interactions etc, they\\'re very good. On the rest, you\\'ll get an accurate answer,  though not necessarily a  GOOD one. Again, this is much easier at off-peak hours.  \\n\\n\\n4:  Check your prescription against the medication you receive.  Make sure it\\'s the right med, and that the quantities of pills and refills are correct.

My friends and I were unable to have a conversation without screaming, and I actually felt so anxious I felt sick, so we ended our meal as quickly as we could.  The hostess said, \"Oh, when the DJ is here we play music because people start dancing.\"  When I asked where they could possibly find space to dance, she said, \"On tables, chairs, everywhere, you\\'ll see!\"  This sounded like my worst nightmare and was NOT ADVERTISED ON THEIR MENU OR ANYWHERE OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT or I absolutely never would have brunched there.

So, after Comic Con this year, we thought it would be interesting to walk up to this restaurant and try it out once and for all.\\n\\nEnvironment 7/10: First off, it's a corner-of-the-block kind of place so it isn't hard to miss and the outdoor seating goes all around; always a nice touch and one that we took advantage of. The seating was surprisingly spacious enough for us two, as it sat for four, with all of our merch and bags from the convention. Depending on how you feel about the streets and people outside, you are fenced off but you still have the busy and noisy road right in front of you but like I said, depending how you are with noisy and loud surroundings with your meal, I say go inside but we were happy as is. The bathroom was amazingly clean and very spacious, with the sick being away from the toilet and 'relief utensils' as my uncle calls them so if you need to wash your hands, you can do that without holding up anyone who had finished their 'duty'.\\n\\nService 6/10: The service was very good and I have very little to argue in this category with my review. We were seated within 5-7 minutes, considering how crowded and busy the restaurant was. The server was very frequent with our requests: taking our orders, refills, check, etc. They were professional and formal and made our time pleasant. One thing that had gotten on our nerves at one point was toward the end of out meal, we eventually asked for the bill. While the server went back inside to retrieve our tab, we waited almost ten minutes. Figured while awaiting his return, I made my way to find the bathrooms. While turning around to get up, I peered into the establishment and caught our server just leaning and hanging out by the bar, talking with a fellow employee as well as what seemed to be a customer whom he could have possibly knew, Im not sure.What ever the case was, I wasn't happy having to wait for them on my way out because they chose to take a few minutes to themselves and hold us up from our plans. I can only imagine how many more times this happened.\\n\\nFood Quality 6/10: Last but not least, the food. Merg had ordered a vegetarian dish, artichoke dip with cheddar tots, and I went with the buffalo chicken breast with fries aside from an order of beer pretzel sticks to split. My sandwich was without a doubt delicious as well as the fried that accompanied it but the sauce had been drizzled over it, rather than the sauce be all over the fillet. I can also assume that our waiter had struck up another conversation on the way to get our order because the sauce had gone a bit hard and slightly chilled instead of the intended hot. We both agree that the pretzel sticks were nice, crisp with a sweet and soft center. The downside was the dip; oily, runny, soggy and beyond garlicky for the mrs.; and that says a lot coming from a girl who kisses a guy who eats whole cloves of the stuff. Another element that bugged me was pricing. Now, I'm not saying that I didn't do my research on this place's affordability before I chose to attend it. But when I can order dishes at other places, one's that are cooked nicely as well as properly, and I can view other eateries literally right across the street from me when my eating experience isn't going so well, it truly does hurt my time spent at 5.N.B.\\n\\nOverall: We will admit we did enjoy my time here considering the company and also with just how much fun we had that day with the comic convention and all but when it came to finally settling down from being on our feet all day and just relaxing to some 'up-scale bar food', we were a bit disappointed. With our leisurely server taking their time, the food's pricing, as well as it reputation not matching its expected quality, we were let down but at least we were full.

On top of everything, the drinks are so damn pricey that it'll make anyone think twice if they want to get wasted here without pregaming.\\n\\nOn the brighter note, if you're a girl and your date/man is paying for you, take the free ride and enjoy the night cuz this place is sick to drink and dance to some amazing tunes. Guys on the other hand, with a heavy heart my friends, be prepared to pay that big fat check you'll expect to see that night.\", 'label': 0.0}, {'text': u'Um when eating from this restaurant I would avoid any dish that comes in goopy sauce i.e. \"pepper steak\" \"any meat w mushrooms\" \"any meat in black bean sauce\". They\\'re pretty stingy so you won\\'t even find crushed garlic in that sauce, just tasteless corn starchy brown oil goop. Did I mention oily? Yeah for some reason all the dishes in sauce are pretty goopy and OILY. So I suggest you stick with anything that is deep fried (i.e. chicken wings, scallops, fried wantons) as they cook at such a high temp that they absorb little eye or go with a chicken w broccoli or chicken w mixed vegetables. Also 9 times out of 10 the eggdrop soup is watered down.

Never in my ten years of living in NYC has this ever happened to me!!!\\n\\nI ordered delivery a few weeks back from them, and I had ordered delivery a few times before, never anything to write home about, but good for late night diner food. Me and a friend were excited for our food. I ate a bit of my tuna deluxe salad. Until I uncover this little cockroach in my coleslaw. I wasn't even too upset. Honestly I've been in the restaurant business for 16 years. Stuff happens. This has never happened to me before, although I've heard stories. What I was and am particularly upset with, and why I'm posting it is how the owner treated me after I called to tell them. He refused to say it came from them. Because I magically put the cockroach in and buried and it in my soggy coleslaw for a free $10 dish so I could argue with you about it for 20 minutes. He finally agrees rudely to a refund. But says I have to come in to swipe my card for a refund. My companion didn't eat his food either. We also had to order food from somewhere else and wait for it. I myself could not eat because I was sick to my stomach and had been upset. \\n\\nI go in and he's gone. And his sweet employee apologizes to me and says he's only authorized to refund me $10, when what we ordered was $28. I brought the food back with me. I decided to come back again an hour later when I knew he'd be there. When I went back in for my refund he again insulted me and said he did not care and did not believe the cockroach was from there and that I must have put it in my food! And that I am a naive little girl who doesn't know what she is doing. I don't care what he thinks this is not how you speak to customers! Especially when you are in the wrong. And I had many of my own thoughts about a man in his 80's who probably has had many interesting bias's from the early part of the century that don't really work with today any longer. This is why I am posting this.\\n\\n I honestly would not have put so much time and wasted energy into this if he had not been SOOOOOOOOO rude to me!!! I have never in my life been spoken to this way in a restaurant. This owner is a disgusting human being who needs to learn how to treat customers and other human beings. I will never go back here again. Needless to say I was upset. I called the health department on him the next day and made a complaint. I have a photo of the cockroach that I wish I could add to this review. I have worked in many restaurants over the course of 16 almost 17 years, ten of those years being in NY, and I've managed 3. I have never EVER spoken to or treated a customer the way he treated me! The cockroach was in my soggy coleslaw and I have a photo to prove it.

That makes this the only coffee place I know of in NYC that sells the best roasters I have so far come across in my life, though their own rendition is somewhat beset by very slight over-bitterness and lack of nuance, compared to SoMa's original.

Flavors are pretty amazing and almost as good as 16 Handles. It's like a fraction of a mili-second away from being THAT good. But it gets five stars clearly because no one hassles you for taking more than 2 samples and the prices are significantly cheaper than 16 Handles. \\n\\nI love Fro-yo.

You have various fruits and mashed up candy bars, chocolate chips, a variety of nuts and more chocolate, coconut, nilla wafers, graham crackers, etc. etc. Frozen yogurt is healthier than ice cream, so why the hell not.

I\\'ve been here at least 10-15 times in my life dating back to 2007 and each experience never EVER disappoints! It\\'s always fun to come with a group of friends, especially when their main objective is to drink. Now time to give the real rundown from all of my Kenka wisdom and pass it down to the next generation.\\n\\nFirst, get here early! On weekdays (specifically M-Th), it usually doesn\\'t get overly-crowded at the open at 6pm, but the crowd will build up FAST! You will usually get a seat if you get here by 6, but as the night progresses a wait builds up. As for weekends (specifically Friday and Saturday), the most popular days, there WILL be a crowd outside before 6pm, so get there early to put your name down if you don\\'t want to wait. Small parties get in fairly quickly, but parties of 7+ can easily wait over an hour.\\n\\nOnce you get in, you will notice nude photos on the wall and other interesting artifacts. It\\'s a nice touch that peeks the interests of the curious, especially when drunk. On the menu, there are definitely some interesting tidbits and rules you should be VERY AWARE of as the night goes on. Some of those rules include no vomiting on the premises, no sake-bombs, no fighting, etc....the usual right? Any broken rules result in a $20 fine, so get that wallet ready if you\\'re going to drink till your liver explodes because I\\'ve actually had a friend break one of those rules and pay up.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to celebrate and drink heavily, I highly recommend buying a bottle or a few bottles of the sake. Great way to lose your sobriety very quickly. In addition, there are the pitchers of beer you can get or for the more adventurous the \"snake shot\". YES \"snake shot\"! There\\'s an actual dead rattle snake inside the bottle they serve you with and it\\'s some potent stuff. \\n\\nAs for food, there\\'s plenty to mention, but some of my favorites include the french fries (with ketchup and mayo) and anything chicken, just to keep it simple. If you\\'re looking to challenge someone, then by all means order the bull penis and turkey testicles. Call it very bizarre as many will, but they actually are quite appetizing, if unappealing. However, if you\\'re looking to \"eat\" here, maybe those 2 items shouldn\\'t be on your mind.\\n\\nIf you do stay here all night till close to 4am (closing), which I have done on multiple occasions, be ready for the very intoxicated that are still there to entertain you as they (specifically the girls) bumble, stumble and possibly even make out in front of you. All in all, it\\'s a fun place to be when you\\'re looking for a night out on the town with the guys and gals!', 'label': 0.0}, {'text': u\"Place changed ordered martini taste like they didn't clean the shaker fish had off taste next day sick as a dog no more Fiorentinos for me.\", 'label': 1.0}, {'text': u\"This is the worst Thai food I have ever eaten.

Also, the Ginga Kogen, which is like Hefe Weizen, is exceptional. It\\'s according to the table as very \"refreshing.\" \\n\\nThe food:\\n\\nEgg on Egg on Egg- sea urchin, sturgeon caviar over a bed of scrambled eggs. This dish kinda signified everything good and holy in this world. LOL The dish was good, but I feel the scrambled egg with a slight kick from the Uni were the predominant flavors. I barely noticed the caviar at all. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=spQBVg_hNazyU1sV6vuSqw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\\n\\nTsukune- chicken meat ball, foie gras with poached egg.

I thought this dish was nice, the octopus was nice and tender. The dish is served cold and the zucchini works nicely. \\n\\nBurgundy Truffle & Market Vegetables- string beans, snap peas, butternut squash, radicchios, endives in a truffle soy vinaigrette. I thought this dish was a little odd that it was cold. Guess I was expecting it to be hot. The massive chunks of truffle are pretty sick though. It was a nice dish, but not a wow dish.\\n\\nDaikon Mochi- bacon, Miyabi nori with wasabi pickled Kyoto greens. This dish was not my fav, this dish really reminded me of Spanish arepitas.

It\\'s a pretty dish, but I was kinda disappointed. This is kinda the go to dish for modern Asian places and it was just OK for me. I wasn\\'t impressed with the orange rind or orange reduction.

The scallion pancakes were OK but did not have enough flavor to them. The mapo tofu was delicious and the tofu tasted fresh. The worst dish was the sauteed aromatic shrimp which was mouth numbing experience. The color of the dish was brown and looked over cooked. My boyfriend and I were so hungry at that point thatwe decided to give it a go. The minute we ate this our mouths started to go numb and the taste was as if they had poured gasoline in the dish. I understand some of it might be the spice but I've had enough Sichuan style food that I know what it should taste like. After we ate this, our bodies started to tingle and we felt nausea for about 4 hours. I looked up these symptoms and it's the case of over using MSG. There was SO MUCH MSG used in this dish that my body had a reaction to it instantaneously.

I saw all the great reviews and said to myself this is going to be great because Yelp is typically on target when it comes to reviewing restaurants. Before I begin to describe all the elements that made this the worst brunch I have ever had, allow me to make the following assertion. Any establishment that has tables, a waiting staff, and serves food, should offer the patrons an opportunity to order a caffeinated beverage. Japanese restaurants offer tea. Night clubs offer Red-Bull and Vodka. Even a frozen yogurt store is likely to offer coffee flavored yogurt. Hop Devil Grill not only failed to include coffee as an optional part of their brunch beverage menu. They lacked the ability to make it. The waitress admitted to us that she, \"\"broke the machine a month ago and they never got it fixed.\"\" It was at this moment that they should have lost all credibility in my eyes. But I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. I said to myself this can\\'t get any worse. It\\'s not like they are going to serve us bloody mary\\'s with chunks of horseradish in it that looked more like scum that should be floating in a dirty aquarium than a common brunch beverage ingredient. It\\'s not as if today I might learn that Huevos Rancheros is spanish for \"\"certain food poisoning.\"\" If I wanted to eat Goya rice and beans and two undercooked eggs I would have went to the supermarket and prepared breakfast at home. And even I can reasonably expect to cook eggs properly. How do I know? Because I am not a 5 year old with a diminished mental capacity. I would have been better off going to Tompkins square park and joining the smelly junkie bums for the regular Saturday afternoon soup giveaways. Chances are I could have found something more appetizing in a dumpster outside most restaurants in Manhattan. One might argue that 20 dollars for an all you can drink 90 minute brunch is a great deal. I would disagree because no amount of alcohol could possibly have made this food remotely edible. I could have had 20 mimosas and the food would still be way more likely to induce vomiting than any type of alcohol related sickness. So would I recommend Hop Devil Grill? No. In fact if you have no food in your house and 20 dollars to spend, I would recommend that you burn the money and eat a bunch of different condiments that you may have in your refridgerator. And if you have not one edible item to your name just fast.

We had a nice number of pints before the game and with in the first half. In the 2nd half a member of the group went up to order another two more rounds of beers as it was not easy to order with so many people packed in. When we finished the rounds of beer off there was about 20 minutes left in the game, nerves were high and the bar was packed so trying to order another drink was difficult.  Two members of the group had not put down their empty glasses when a member of management came over and said \"If we were not going to buy another beer then we would be asked to leave. This was not our living room and that the bar was in the business of making money\".  We were shocked to the point that we said it had to be a joke. But he said it again and again, he said he was not joking. When I asked to speak with a member of management he said he was management. When I expressed my view on what he had said to us he informed me to \"shut up\" or I would be kicked out. His tone was very rude and many people around us seen this going on and they were not impressed. It was like he was looking for an argument as he pushed us more and more. This was by far the worst treatment I have ever had to deal with in a bar ( people getting kicked out because they were not drinking lots and fast). We were about to stay for dinner and to order more drinks but we left with ten minutes to go and the 7 of us went next door to see the game out.

One day, there were about six men behind the counter and the restaurant was relatively empty, they still took 5 minutes before they even got to me. They were too concerned with socializing with each other. Also, they&#39;re often quite rude and talk down to you. They forget parts of your order and get pissy when you ask them to correct their mistakes. One time, I didn&#39;t tip because of their terrible service and one of the guys made a smartarsed remark about it. \\n\\nThe other complaint is their chicken. I&#39;ve gotten their chicken heroes twice now. The first time, the chicken was way too overcooked and didn&#39;t even resemble or taste like meat at that point. The second time, the chicken must&#39;ve been rotten or something. My friend and I both got sick from the heroes. I haven&#39;t been back for lunch since, so, I can&#39;t attest to the quality of the rest of their lunch selections.\\n\\nStick to the breakfast basics and they&#39;re fine, but, I&#39;d recommend not going when you&#39;re in a rush.

Won\\'t say that its a horrible place because that would be a lie. Ever since Tomo opened in my area I instantly started buying food there. Let\\'s just say sometimes I bought food from Tomo on a 3 time a week basis. The driver already recognized my face and so did the staff at the restaurant, they always said hello when they saw me at the restaurant. When I didn\\'t order in a while, some staff would tell me, \"hi long time, how have you been?\" Yes I ordered that much!

I asked the lady over the phone to remove my info as I no longer want to do business with them. She replied with a simple, \"ok we will remove.\" The reason I asked for this is because they had a habit of leaving my credit cards on file.

I\\'ve been here at least 10-15 times in my life dating back to 2007 and each experience never EVER disappoints! It\\'s always fun to come with a group of friends, especially when their main objective is to drink. Now time to give the real rundown from all of my Kenka wisdom and pass it down to the next generation.\\n\\nFirst, get here early! On weekdays (specifically M-Th), it usually doesn\\'t get overly-crowded at the open at 6pm, but the crowd will build up FAST! You will usually get a seat if you get here by 6, but as the night progresses a wait builds up. As for weekends (specifically Friday and Saturday), the most popular days, there WILL be a crowd outside before 6pm, so get there early to put your name down if you don\\'t want to wait. Small parties get in fairly quickly, but parties of 7+ can easily wait over an hour.\\n\\nOnce you get in, you will notice nude photos on the wall and other interesting artifacts. It\\'s a nice touch that peeks the interests of the curious, especially when drunk. On the menu, there are definitely some interesting tidbits and rules you should be VERY AWARE of as the night goes on. Some of those rules include no vomiting on the premises, no sake-bombs, no fighting, etc....the usual right? Any broken rules result in a $20 fine, so get that wallet ready if you\\'re going to drink till your liver explodes because I\\'ve actually had a friend break one of those rules and pay up.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to celebrate and drink heavily, I highly recommend buying a bottle or a few bottles of the sake. Great way to lose your sobriety very quickly. In addition, there are the pitchers of beer you can get or for the more adventurous the \"snake shot\". YES \"snake shot\"! There\\'s an actual dead rattle snake inside the bottle they serve you with and it\\'s some potent stuff. \\n\\nAs for food, there\\'s plenty to mention, but some of my favorites include the french fries (with ketchup and mayo) and anything chicken, just to keep it simple. If you\\'re looking to challenge someone, then by all means order the bull penis and turkey testicles. Call it very bizarre as many will, but they actually are quite appetizing, if unappealing. However, if you\\'re looking to \"eat\" here, maybe those 2 items shouldn\\'t be on your mind.\\n\\nIf you do stay here all night till close to 4am (closing), which I have done on multiple occasions, be ready for the very intoxicated that are still there to entertain you as they (specifically the girls) bumble, stumble and possibly even make out in front of you.

I didn&#39;t get said spinach roll, and when I called the restaurant back to ask where it was, they refused to pick up the phone. For a solid hour. And I know they were actively avoiding phone calls because every time I called there was a busy signal, meaning they took the phone off the hook, and the second I called when there was none, it would ring for a solid 10 minutes, and then immediately go back to busy signal. \\nI don&#39;t understand how any business that wants to retain any sort of clientele would work in such a manner.\\nI also realized shortly after this, that this Luigi&#39;s is owned by the same mediocre-to-awful Luigi&#39;s that I reviewed a week ago! Had I known, I never would&#39;ve ordered from here, knowing it would be an absolute complete waste of money.\\n\\nSo let&#39;s get on with what else they did wrong... (shocker)...\\n\\nI ordered a caesar salad. It came with a handful of lettuce, bare minimum of dressing (coating the bottom of the aluminum dish it came with, and little else), and a few croutons. It tasted ok. Had it been substantial, I wouldn&#39;t have minded paying for it.\\n\\nI also ordered a penne ala vodka, which, although it tasted decent (3/5 stars), it had no Parmesan, and not the slightest hint of pepper - which it desperately needed. The aluminum tin was also 1/3 full. I think I could count the pieces of pasta we received. If you&#39;ve got some time on your hands, you can count them via the photo I uploaded. It was roughly 30. That&#39;s not worth what we paid for it.\\n\\nI ordered zeppoli, and instead of getting zeppoli, which are balls of dough deep fried, and completely covered in powdered sugar - instead I got tire-shaped pieces of dough (half the size of regular zeppoli), which not only aren&#39;t zeppoli, but are also covered in so little powdered sugar, that I could barely tell it existed in the first place. They were chewy (to the point of actually hurting your jaw), and tasted old and stale.\\n\\nI ordered beef patties, which were good, but how hard is it to re-heat Jamaican beef patties after they&#39;ve already been made for you?\\n\\nI so rarely give a place 1 star - I usually reserve it for restaurants where I literally get sick off the food. But this place was so dismissive, didn&#39;t care about their customers complaints (like paying for something online that was never delivered), and going so far as to take their phone off the hook to avoid answering it when a customer complains... \\nCome on, that&#39;s just nonsense. And it&#39;s nonsense that no one should have to deal with.\\n\\nNo thank you. I will most CERTAINLY be ordering from elsewhere, and advise that you do the same.\\n\\nTheir ignoring of my phone calls is frustrating, and the longer they ignore, the longer my frustration grows, because you know what - when you mess up an order - especially one that a customer has already paid for - it&#39;s your responsibility as a conscientious restaurant - to make sure that customer gets said order - even if they order an hour before your closing time, and it takes you an hour to deliver it, leaving them less than a minute to call you back to complain about the order you messed up. And if it&#39;s an inconvenience to you to remain open for a few mins. longer when you&#39;ve messed up someone else&#39;s order, then that&#39;s something you should deal with. Now I&#39;M dealing with a messed up order until they re-open tomorrow at noon, and I&#39;ll be starving all night for them having forgotten my meal, (the rest of this order was my boyfriend&#39;s - thankfully I stole a bite of everything), and being too cocky to pick up the phone to remedy it. \\n\\n[Edit] - I&#39;m increasing their rating to 2 stars because they just agreed to deliver the spinach roll I didn&#39;t get yesterday. It tastes ok (3/5) but is about 25% smaller than your average spinach roll. They make the same mistake of their Ave. U Luigi&#39;s location of not chopping the spinach up first, so you take a bite, and the entire rolls contents drag out of the dough, and are gone.

First, I ordered the pork topping (the alternative is chicken), which ended up being two small pieces of rubbery pork. They use very lean meat, which they proceed to overcook... Ick! Second, most of the ramen varieties come with only bean sprouts, meat, scallions, and an egg if you\\'re lucky. You have to pay extra for toppings, even the simple ones like nori and corn will set you back an additional dollar per add-on, which I think is kind of tacky. Third, the wait is absolutely egregious. I cannot believe that even showing up as early as 4:30pm did not save me from a 45-minute wait. \\n\\nSide note: I also saw a waiter chase down a customer who he thought did not tip enough...

I probably wouldn&#39;t get the pre packaged sushi that&#39;s covered in condensation on a Sunday afternoon, but honestly, who would? However I am sick and tired of the poor customer service. I work at a hotel on 44th street and have been going to caf? 45 for over two years now (two to three times a week). At every other restaurant, deli, and pizza joint in the area I will be greeted with a warm welcome (or at least a hello). At caf? 45 I feel like I am somehow a burden to the staff and my ordering a sandwich has in some way wasted their time. This Sunday I was one of two people in the place. They had three guys behind the counter, a woman at the register on her cell, and another guy cleaning the counter. It took them almost ten minutes for them to acknowledge me, let alone take my order. I handed them a written order from a coworker and then gave mine (three times because he was too busy talking to his buddy behind the counter to listen to me). I paid my bill (which was a little pricey for two sandwiches and a bag of chips) and made my way back to work. Only to find that they had added items to the order I handed to them and forgot items on the one I voiced to them. Sadly, this is not the first time I&#39;ve had this happen and honestly it&#39;s my own fault for ever going back after the first dozen screwed up orders. From now on I will be taking my business next door to Ambrosia or to City Caf? on 43rd street. Both of those establishments have never screwed up an order; have a much friendlier staff, and the same (if not better) quality of food.

I remember it being a good experience as a child, so I decided to revisit the restaurant again as a teenager. But from what I recall, that experience was terrible. I ordered the only thing most people order from here, and that&#39;s the pork chop over rice. The dish was too salty and it almost tasted as if the pork may have been a bit past it&#39;s expiration date--rotten to say the least. I recall not finishing my dish at all.\\n\\nFast forward a couple years ahead, to last night and here we have another problem. Ever since that bad experience I had with the restaurant, I never wanted to go back. However, my boyfriend seems to enjoy the pork chop over rice so we came back for a late night bite. I didn&#39;t want to eat, so he and his friend both ordered.\\n\\nFrom what he told me, the pork was too salty, and he wasn&#39;t much of a tea drinker so we asked for a glass of water to wash down the food. While they were busy talking, I watched as the waiter grabbed a cup and scooped up ice from a dirty white commercial bucket that was sitting on the floor next to the sink to serve water with. I&#39;ve never worked at a restaurant, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not where ice should be taken from.\\n\\nAt this point, I should&#39;ve mentioned something, but I didn&#39;t which I terribly regret.

I turn around and wake up to the sight of him vomiting into the trash can in deep pain. I was confused because he had only had two beers that night, and he definitely does not vomit off two beers.\\n\\nHe had cold sweats, his stomach was in pain and his body was unsettled. By this point, I knew he had gotten food poisoning. He spent the rest of the night vomiting and dry heaving, as if his body was attempting to regurgitate and remove something that would not leave his body. He was constantly running back and forth between the bedroom and the bathroom due to liquid bowels/watery stool that he was barely able to control. These are all severe symptoms of food poisoning.\\n\\nHe spent all of the next day sleeping in attempt to regain energy but his body was still extremely weak after resting for most of the day. This led me to call 311 to report the restaurant and call the poison center where I was informed that if these symptoms do continue, he&#39;d have to go to the hospital, which we both don&#39;t want to have to deal with.\\n\\nI always thought this restaurant was disgusting, but I haven&#39;t felt the need to make a negative review on it until now.

In another aisle, the entire floor was being drilled at in an effort to lift off the old tiles.  Dust and other debris was all over the place.  But forget the renovation... This store is always a dirty place.  And while I've been shopping here for years, I'm staring to get real concerned abou the safety of the food in this place.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Marie Calendar's pie for 10.00 and found when I took it home it was a mess - it obviously sat on a hand truck waiting to be unpacked and put in the freezer for quite some time.  I'm concerned about all the pre sliced (in store sliced) meats and cheeses in one of the coolers where the stuff looks like its been sitting a bit to long.  Everything in this store is a dirty mess.

So, after Comic Con this year, we thought it would be interesting to walk up to this restaurant and try it out once and for all.\\n\\nEnvironment 7/10: First off, it's a corner-of-the-block kind of place so it isn't hard to miss and the outdoor seating goes all around; always a nice touch and one that we took advantage of. The seating was surprisingly spacious enough for us two, as it sat for four, with all of our merch and bags from the convention. Depending on how you feel about the streets and people outside, you are fenced off but you still have the busy and noisy road right in front of you but like I said, depending how you are with noisy and loud surroundings with your meal, I say go inside but we were happy as is. The bathroom was amazingly clean and very spacious, with the sick being away from the toilet and 'relief utensils' as my uncle calls them so if you need to wash your hands, you can do that without holding up anyone who had finished their 'duty'.\\n\\nService 6/10: The service was very good and I have very little to argue in this category with my review. We were seated within 5-7 minutes, considering how crowded and busy the restaurant was. The server was very frequent with our requests: taking our orders, refills, check, etc. They were professional and formal and made our time pleasant. One thing that had gotten on our nerves at one point was toward the end of out meal, we eventually asked for the bill. While the server went back inside to retrieve our tab, we waited almost ten minutes. Figured while awaiting his return, I made my way to find the bathrooms. While turning around to get up, I peered into the establishment and caught our server just leaning and hanging out by the bar, talking with a fellow employee as well as what seemed to be a customer whom he could have possibly knew, Im not sure.What ever the case was, I wasn't happy having to wait for them on my way out because they chose to take a few minutes to themselves and hold us up from our plans. I can only imagine how many more times this happened.\\n\\nFood Quality 6/10: Last but not least, the food. Merg had ordered a vegetarian dish, artichoke dip with cheddar tots, and I went with the buffalo chicken breast with fries aside from an order of beer pretzel sticks to split. My sandwich was without a doubt delicious as well as the fried that accompanied it but the sauce had been drizzled over it, rather than the sauce be all over the fillet. I can also assume that our waiter had struck up another conversation on the way to get our order because the sauce had gone a bit hard and slightly chilled instead of the intended hot. We both agree that the pretzel sticks were nice, crisp with a sweet and soft center. The downside was the dip; oily, runny, soggy and beyond garlicky for the mrs.; and that says a lot coming from a girl who kisses a guy who eats whole cloves of the stuff. Another element that bugged me was pricing. Now, I'm not saying that I didn't do my research on this place's affordability before I chose to attend it. But when I can order dishes at other places, one's that are cooked nicely as well as properly, and I can view other eateries literally right across the street from me when my eating experience isn't going so well, it truly does hurt my time spent at 5.N.B.\\n\\nOverall: We will admit we did enjoy my time here considering the company and also with just how much fun we had that day with the comic convention and all but when it came to finally settling down from being on our feet all day and just relaxing to some 'up-scale bar food', we were a bit disappointed. With our leisurely server taking their time, the food's pricing, as well as it reputation not matching its expected quality, we were let down but at least we were full.

The food is great and makes me feel like I am back traveling in Thailand however on this recent trip I got kind of sick from the food, too much MSG? Really I have never had a bad experience here but if sensitive to MSG you might want to skip it.  I love all the soups, salads, and curries.  Cash only.', 'label': 1.0}, {'text': u\"Went here at 8pm on a Monday night. Wait was 30 min for 2 so we went around the corner to the other room for a drink.\\nWe got a great corner table. Restaurant is quiet loud but has nice ambience. Shared artichoke salad special (raw artichokes, would have been better grilled). For pastas we got tagliatelle with ragu and spinach gnocchi with spicy red sauce. Tagliatelle was drenched in red sauce. I like that but maybe not for everyone. Spicy red sauce was so spicy it gave me a stomach ache. Should have stuck to red sauce. Pastas were average, hearty portions good for a cold night.\\nTiramisu with dessert was covered in chocolate sauce. After scraping it off, tiramisu itself was pretty good.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nI actually felt pretty sick after the meal as did my boyfriend. Like the atmosphere but wouldn't go back for the food.\", 'label': 1.0}, {'text': u'Went here for a friends birthday with the promise that it had amazing food. I&#39;m not a fan of BBQ but she said there was non bbq things to eat. Well this place is SO memorable!!!! Two hours later it gave me my very first case of food poisoning!!! Never in my life have i ever been so sick. i thought i was DYING. Dying actually would have been preferable to food poisoning. It&#39;s not like i could have just gone home either. I live on Long Island so i had my boyfriend get a cab to take us to Penn Station where the food poisoning hit full force. Thankfully there was a Rite Aide where i was able to obtain a bottle of pepto to chug. 3 days later i felt better but i can tell you i will NEVER EVER E V E R go back to that place.

I do give the owner efforts for offering us a free desert, but again it was below par.

Can't understand how so many people had such great experiences.  Everything we ordered from the appetizer to the main course was bland... it was flat out plain with no taste.

A cool, souvenir glass cup that comes complimentary with any alcoholic drink, and food poisoning.\\n\\nDon't be fooled into the aesthetically pleasing style of the restaurant with its fancy bar lights and cool Mexican theme, it's a trap.\\n\\nThey claim to have the best guacamole in NYC but it's nothing but ordinary. It's tasty but I've definitely had better. As for the entrees, they're burritos and quesadillas are quite gross. I feel bad saying that the food is so bad, but really, don't go here. My burrito was filled with gooey cheese that was barely discernible between what I thought was sour cream and american cheese, and the beans are flavored with some $2 McCormick ready made spice bags. As for the side of cheese we got for our fries, it was definitely tostitos cheese from the can. How disgusting.\\n\\nBut, the only reason I'm giving two stars and not one is because of the drinks. They're drinks are $13 for a hefty size and a good amount of alcohol. And you get to keep the souvenirs glass!\\n\\nService: not too bad.

Them I moved to New Jack City and experienced some of the corner bodegas making fresh salads as you choose the toppings. Then I tried chop't, tossed, Just Salad and Sweet Greens as I am always eating a healthy lunch. \\n\\nAll those roads led me down this path to the Mecca of salad customization. Their dressings are delicious, their proteins are all fresh, filled with flavor and nutrition.  I actually laugh at the selection at the other places... Fried chicken at chop't? Disgusting. You can tell all of the meats and half of the other toppings at the chain locations are prepared so that they can be dispersed from one location and last in the fridge for up to 14 days!  Gross who in their right mind wants to eat that.  \\n\\nI can feel the nutrients coursing through my veins as I finish the salad now.  Quit having a boring salad, quit having a boring life. \\n\\nSpinach and kale, tuna, falafel, grilled kale, roasted carrots, jalepenos, fresh onion, pumpkin seeds, cherry tomatoes, avocado, quinoa, Bulgarian feta.
