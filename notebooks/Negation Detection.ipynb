It didn&#39;t take long for me to get addicted to their selection of coffees and baked muffins leading to me getting their lunch sandwiches as well. After frequenting the cafe more than 13 times within 10 business days I encountered my first MOLDY MUFFIN! The worst part is, the mold was forming on the bottom rim of the muffin and because I was eating it from the top, I didn&#39;t notice until I was midway through! In Shock, I brought the other half back to the cafe and even the cashier was stunned after I showed her! She apologized and in the midst of the moment (she may have been struck by stupidity) but asked me if I wanted another muffin rather than a refund. I&#39;m not the type of person to make a scene so I kindly declined and got my money back.\n",

If this visit had no issues I definitely would still go there, but it may have been a coincidence where the large piece of cheese on my sandwich looked as though there were little white/clear fuzzy things on it! I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES! I asked my co-worker to look at it confirming it was mold! I really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and believe it was pieces of the wax paper stuck to the cheese, but wax paper just doesn&#39;t leave that type of fuzzy residue. I was so disappointed, not to mention I did get a stomach ache this time from the food.  I really wish this place would just carry more &#34;fresh&#34; food items, practice better hygiene (maybe just check the muffins they leave sitting out in the pan), because I honestly did LOVE the food here.  I just can&#39;t bring myself to go here anymore because I&#39;m scared of what is going to be growing on/in my food...Not to mention the employees are super nice. *sigh* Another good place lost\n",

We asked our original waiter what is this for he, said that they add tips to checks over $100 dollars.  That rule is not printed on menu.  Basically that waiter decided to back up his racist co-worker.  Our check for 3 of was under $100.  I decided to ask the white family of 4, next to us to see their check, it was over $100 and no service fee was added.  Their waiter claimed he was busy and he knew them.    We showed the family our check and they were as shocked as we were.  The ignorant, racist, theft, waiter quickly took back the check and wrote a new one.

      "There was only 1 other table besides ours when we went in for dinner. The server was asking how we were when another woman whispers in his ear while pointing and looking at us. We were immediately concerned over what she was saying. There was no way it was anything like \"make sure you treat them well\" or she wouldn't be whispering. I don't know what possessed us to stay. We had the fish and it was just okay. We were concerned the food was tampered with from the whispering. Fortunately, neither of us got sick but there is no way we will return. Why stop our server, look and point at us and whisper something in his ear right in front of us? We talked about it afterwards and came to the conclusion that if we return we are just begging for them to make us sick. I don't know what her problem was with us but she did not shy away from showing it.\n",

      "This is a review on Cooler Cleanse from Juice Generation. I decided to do a 3-day juice cleanse with my friend. We both had no experience with juice cleansing, but thought we would give it a try. We were trying to obtain that \"energetic\" \"detoxed\" feeling that everyone speaks about!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we both hated the juices. They were in no way filling and extremely sweet or extremely sour (spicy lemonade). In no way did we feel satisfied, tired, energetic, or \"cleansed.\" We both felt sick, hungry, and irritated at the cost of this 3-day cleanse ($170) and the ripped-off feeling we had. Both of us felt sick and ended the cleanse a day early. Juice generation cooler cleanse called to ask how I was feeling. I told her I was sick, really did not enjoy it, and didn't feel well, (even today a few days later I'm still not functioning normally!) all she said was \"let me know if you have any other questions or comments.\" I would NOT recommend this. It is a marketing/advertising trap!!!!\n",

      "So I wrote a review right after getting home from this place.  Unfortunately, my review has to change.  I was feeling full when I got home after eating here, and it only got worse.  I couldn't sleep till 3am (I ate there at 8pm), and even when I woke up I felt like I had something stuck in my stomach.  It was a feeling of being super full, my stomach just pushing against my clothes.  Felt so uncomfortable that I couldn't sleep.  Mind you, I have GERD, but haven't had any issues for months.  Also, my friend that took me there told me her friend with IBS ate here and felt horribly sick afterwards.  I don't know if it's all the fiber but something's up.  Thus, went down from 3 to 2 stars.  Just not for me.\n",

      "We decided to try our hand making linguine and clams after getting sick of paying $20+ to get a subpar version at different restaurants. The main problem was finding clams fresh enough for the dish. The last time a friend picked up &#34;fresh&#34; fish at Whole Foods, he had food poisoning. Yelp reviews led us to Rosendo where we got a dozen little neck clams that were on ice. After washing and cooking, every clam popped open and proved to be fresh. \n",

      "We managed to catch Fatta Cuckoo on a bad day. Their chef had called in sick and the sous chef was left by himself in the kitchen to handle all the food orders. The writing was on the wall when we walked in. They messed up our reservation of 2, and had us sit at the bar but we got a free round of drinks so no hard feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with the fried clam special. A bit bready but tasted fine.  We had ordered the burger and the fried chicken, but after waiting for over an hour since the arrival of our app, we still hadn&#39;t gotten them. They recognized this and gave us more free drinks. To give you an idea how backed up they were - our reso was at 730 but we didn&#39;t get our entrees until 915. Finally when my burger came, it was cooked medium well (I had ordered medium rare) and I had no choice but to send it back. To their credit, they gave me another burger within 10 minutes that was cooked much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The short rib burger, at the correct temperature, was pretty good but not sure if it&#39;s worth the $22 price tag even though it does come with a beer. It could be due to the unfortunate case of not having the regular chef that night but while the meat was juicy, it lacked seasoning. The fried chicken wasn&#39;t too different. It was moist under the dark, crispy skin but the flavor didn&#39;t pop as much. Overall I&#39;d give the app and entrees 3.5/5\n",

Not The Girl Next Door was an excellent chili infused mescal cocktail that I&#39;d order over and over again. For something summery and light I would suggest Don&#39;t Tell Carly.\n",
