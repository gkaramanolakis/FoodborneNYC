"What's really amazing is that this place has almost 100% bad reviews, and yet they are still in business. I order from Vine when I get desperate. I try to avoid disappointment by ordering the same simple thing over and over again, but even that isn't foolproof with these people. I usually get the same rude delivery guy (for five years now) who grunts like a Neanderthal because he hasn't bothered to learn one word of English, and who again, like a Neanderthal, snatches my tips and gives me a dirty look as if he's insulted before he scurries away into the forest. 

Not only do they have bad service and average to sub-standard Asian fusion food, but recently I noticed that the portions on some of their dishes have been downsized. Downsized portions of crappy food? Now that's balls beyond the size of Jupiter. 

Finally, after reading some reviews here that reported a dead cockroach in someone's soup, two reports of a queasy stomach and food poisoning, and a health department rating of ""C"", I've decided that there is no level of desperation that will make me order from this place again. There are plenty of restaurants in the Columbia area to choose from, so there's no need to play Russian Roulette. In fact, there's a really good authentic Asian place between 103 and 104 on the west side of the street. It's similar to Vine, but minus the roaches, the crappy food, neanderthal delivery guys, bad service, food poisoning, and overall disappointment.",0.040873098827384331,0
"This place should get zero stars. Yes the food was tasty and authentic AND I personally love a good ""hole in the wall"" AND can tolerate a little dinginess in my eating establishment, BUT this place was filthy! I even tolerated the people handling my food with their bare, grimy hands, but when roaches started crawling on the table while I was eating, I had to draw the line. I completely lost my appetite so I threw away my food and left. Then I looked and saw that their grade from the DOH was pending. Looked up why and found out that the health inspectors came to the same conclusion as I did!

So, I agree with the other reviews that the food is memorable but the unsanitary conditions are unacceptable and dangerous. Someone will get sick, likely already has. I would prefer they increase their prices, buy some gloves for food handling and hire a cleaning service. You have an authentic product, so have some pride in your establishment and respect for your customers.",0.059192919643702824,0
"Delivery the night before: prompt, early and the assembly was well-put-together and COLD! In the morning, I would begin the FOUNDATION cleanse (dun dun dun)!

Day One: It wasn&#39;t terrible because I knew I had things to keep me busy. However, around 3-4 o&#39;clock I crashed and I had to nap. The night didn&#39;t really get any easier because I had to drink the BPC&#39;s rendition of the &#34;master cleanse&#34; drink twice. I have the nut allergy, so I didn&#39;t get to try the much-raved-about cashew drink. I actually loathe this drink because I can feel my teeth rotting from the sweetness (sigh). The cleanse must go on...

The night was dreadful because my dog got sick, so I was up throughout the night cleaning up vomit and errrrrrr...... other things. Trust me, it didn&#39;t make me crave waffles and ice cream, but now I was tired and hungry.

Day Two: Harder than day one! I tried to avoid walking around the city as much as possible because I wanted to snatch food from every person that walked by me eating, and even the street meat carts made me salivate. Walking by a Mexican restaurant I was tempted to just snap a chip off this group&#39;s table and dip it in their guacamole. But hey I get it, the cleanse is all about self-will and self-control. Needless to say, no Mexican for me. I was going home to drink a delicious green juice. I do enjoy the green juice and the pineapple mint janx. Now that is what I look forward to tomorrow.

Day Three: I had to go to work on the airplane today (12 hours on the plane), but first I had to muster up the courage to enter Penn Station to get to work. Everyone and their mother was headed to the Hamptons (at 7:00 in the morning WTF??)  and I avoided the Starbucks in Penn knowing that my green little juice friend would be consumed on the LIRR. The train headed to the airport was crowded with all the WASPS with whales on their shorts, popped collars and Tory Burch bags. And one of them sitting across from me was eating their smoked salmon on a cream cheese bagel. Jerk! I&#39;m a huge fan of breakfast, but what I noticed was a hyper sensitivity to smell. I think I could smell the cold Alaskan waters that fish had been swimming in! I know this review is over clad with details but whilst &#34;cleansing,&#34; I felt like sight, smell and sounds were amplified. I won&#39;t even get into my day at work, but I did feel like a flight attendant that had given up a nicotine addiction cold turkey. I did look forward to cracking a juice open every hour and a half or two, all packed nicely in my BPC cooler with their sweet little ice packs!",0.042210770926032523,0

"We went there because the restaurants that we wanted to go were not open and this is the closest asian food nearby. The decor and presentation of the place looked decent - but very soon we had regrets.

When we entered the restaurant, the people who worked there looked at us, then just ignored us like they didn't see anything.

So we worked further into the restaurant and just stand there, finally someone got us and my husband said the people who work there looks like a zombie, so lifeless and you will see why.

We asked what is good. Being Chinese in a Chinese restaurant, we just wanted something more authentic so we asked that question but the waiter said ""we have pig, seafood, beef and vegetable"" Right like I am illiterate and can't read the menu?

Anyhow, we ordered some food and the first dish was the lotus leaf rice, and I spit it right out on my first bite. It was SPOILED. I was not looking for something delicious, I only wanted something to eat, but that dish totally tasted spoiled and my husband agreed. The sticky rice was also not heated all the way, some part was warm, some part was cold and spoiled - it was a taste of foulness. We spit it back out, and the waiter collected the plate and asked ""are you finished""? I was speechless I didn't want to make a scene. 

They recommended the beef as ""fresh"" so we ordered it, and trust me - Panda express or ANY Chinese take out place does better. Their beef was so overdone with baking soda you can't taste any beef in there.

We both came to the conclusion that the hot water the best out of everything. We got so tricked into this place by the high rating and please don't go there - if you don't want food poisoning please stay out.",0.27753711130789277,0
"I just had one of the most upsetting lunches of my life at Greensquare Tavern, a place where I've gone for several business and personal lunches and dinners and drinks with friends and coworkers. Here's what happened. 

Came with a new coworker to talk business and get to know each other at about 11:45. The place was mostly empty and we were promptly greeted and seated. 

She ordered an Arnold Palmer that ended up being a lemonade seltzer only the first time, then was a splash of iced tea over it the second time. The third time, the waiter poured a lemonade mix or something at the table along with iced tea, which looked much more Arnold Palmer-like but still wasn't quite right, maybe because of the organic/fair trade-type drinks they have or maybe because of a language barrier. But I digress.

My colleague ordered a cheeseburger and I ordered a turkey burger with cheese. Normally the fact that the waiter mixed these two up between two customers wouldn't be a big deal aside from embarrassment that we bit into each others burger and had to awkwardly request and either wait for or take out a redo. HOWEVER, I haven't eaten beef in 16 years and took a bite of her cheeseburger, which could make me sick since ones body isn't used to eating beef after a period of time like this and can have a weird reaction to it.

We asked to speak with a manager who came over to the table basically yelling at us, already on the defensive. He said he had already ""yelled at the moron in the kitchen"" (which for the record I would never want as it was a human mistake -- not a good thing but just an error nonetheless). He didn't let me get a word in and said a haste ""Sorry"" not caring that I was emotionally very upset about what just happened and that was it. 

We eventually got replacement meals and had to pay the $53 with tip for the beef and turkey burger and two nonalcoholic drinks -- he didn't even comp the meal! (Oh, right, he offered lunch on him when I said I was surprised he didn't comp the meal when I walked out shaking because I was so upset.) Unbelievable.

"My overall experience here was mediocre. After waiting for 45 minutes for a table for two, even though we got there at 4:30 on a Sunday, I was definitely HUNGRY and ready to eat what I thought was going to be the most delicious ramen EVER. However, when I left, I was tempted to just tell everyone in that ludicrously long line that the food simply was not worth it.

Let's start with the good. The noodles are chewy, a little salty (in a good way), and have that fun yellow and wavy look (unlike the straight white noodles you find at Ippudo). Another nice surprise was that the broth is made from chicken, so it is lighter and less greasy than pork based broths. I still prefer pork based broth, but Totto's advantage is that it was rich and tasty without being overwhelming and making you feel a little sickly afterward. Lastly, the miso ramen ($11) comes with a half boiled egg, which is my ultimate weakness...a little package of savory creamy heaven!

Now, on to the not-so-great. First, I ordered the pork topping (the alternative is chicken), which ended up being two small pieces of rubbery pork. They use very lean meat, which they proceed to overcook... Ick! Second, most of the ramen varieties come with only bean sprouts, meat, scallions, and an egg if you're lucky. You have to pay extra for toppings, even the simple ones like nori and corn will set you back an additional dollar per add-on, which I think is kind of tacky. Third, the wait is absolutely egregious. I cannot believe that even showing up as early as 4:30pm did not save me from a 45-minute wait. 

Side note: I also saw a waiter chase down a customer who he thought did not tip enough... Last time I checked, this is a free country, tips are a gratuity not a right, and you get them when you provide good service.

The food was good (by ""good"" I mean 'above average', but not 'great') but the restaurant's too-cool-for-school attitude is so incredibly annoying. The ramen is 100% NOT WORTH THE WAIT. Go somewhere else, otherwise you'll leave Totto kicking yourself, wondering why you just let yourself waste an hour of your life waiting to get a bowl of ""above average"" ramen.",0.026878261120872899,0

"I have eaten here probably 100+ times, because I work across the street and it is so convenient. But after my 7th or 8th bout of  mild food poisoning (no joke), I think it&#39;s time I called it quits. Basically, anything that hasn&#39;t been made within the previous 5 minutes has had enough bacteria grow on it due to being prepared in unsanitary conditions that it&#39;ll make you sick. You can expect that from any open salad/chinese food bar, so eating from Cafe Duke&#39;s salad bar would be your fault. But the sushi served here is the lowest quality served in the city, which is saying a lot, and I have twice seen someone mop the floors and then prepare sandwiches for delivery without washing their hands. The worst part? The terrible attitude of the people that work there, particularly the night manager. 

These guys will be in business forever because they are smart enough to take up space on a block next to law firms, investment banks and other businesses where people try and find the fastest food possible, without regard to cost. That&#39;s why they are able to have whole aisles of super-overpriced &#34;health bars&#34; and granola-nonsense (up to $6+ a granola bar!) just because they know that most of the people who walk in here are getting their meal paid for by their employer/client.

So we ordered our food about 2 hours ago. Starting at the one hour mark we began calling them to see where our food was. We were told it was out already.

After another 15 minutes we were told that the quoted us incorrectly and that our food had just left and would be here in 5 minutes. After ANOTHER 15 minutes we tried to called back, and have been doing so for at least 10 minutes, but the phone line is busy or just rings and rings. Now we are in limbo because it's almost 10 o'clock, many of our usual delivery places are closed and we don't even know if these people are going to show up so we can't order anything else. Oh wait!!

I studied abroad in Puebla, Mexico, and one of the things I miss most, and nearly impossible to find at Mexican restaurants here in Horchata, a traditional Mexican drink.

"I was relaxing in my bed at around 6:30 pm and was ready for a nap. My girlfriend came into the bedroom and said, ""BABE COME ON GET UP! WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT; ALL WEEK LONG YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO CHECK OUT THE SPOTTED PIG."" After 20 minutes of laying down I got dressed quickly and we were ready to go. 

I had decided to drive into the city from Astoria since the place was all the way on the Westside. Finding parking in this area was truly a mentally and physically challenging task in itself. After looking for parking for 45 minutes we were starving and walked over to the Spotted Pig at 8pm. 

Upon arrival to the Spotted Pig I then met our hostess or host? Sebastian. I nick named him Sebastian due to this Diesel Short Short Jeans, poor attitude and poor customer service skills. I do not know what his real name is but Sebastian seemed fitting for him.  Sebastian told us it would be a 90 minute wait for a table. We figured we were already here. Why not? We heard great things. I put my name down; he took my number and said he would call me. We walked around the city for a little bit and then stopped by a bar called the Dublin Pub I believe.  We got a couple drinks and then headed back to the Spotted Pig. We were hoping that the wait time was better.

At 9pm we were greeted by Sebastian again. He informed us that it would be another 30-45 minutes for a table. His hands were flailing around and I let my girlfriend handle the situation. I was irritated enough already and do not do well in those types of situations. The bar and place were packed!  Every step we went people were bumping into us. Waiters would walk by with food and we were starving. Luckily I bumped into someone I knew at the bar that was also waiting hours for a table. 

My girlfriend would walk over to Sebastian every 20 minutes or so hoping for some good news. Sebastian was quite indifferent and did not seem to care that we were waiting for 2 hours for a cheese burger.  He was unapologetic and was doing an awful job.

We FINALLY got seated at around 10:15-10:30pm. Yes we actually had to wait around 2  1/2 hours for a table!  The quarters were pretty close and we were basically sitting on top of the people next to us. There were a lot of tourists and asshole hipsters there giving us dirty looks. I am born and raised in New York City and do not care about you. 

We got our food at around 10:45pm. We got an order of deviled eggs and chicken liver toast for appetizers which were banging. We both ordered the burger that everyone ranted and raved about. I wasn't really impressed with the burger.  It was just a normal burger; the cheese was a bit too strong. The shoe string fries were normal fries you can get at Outback. My girlfriend said she would have preferred a burger from FIVE GUYS or SHAKE SHACK instead and I agreed with her. 

Over all the food was pretty good but the service and wait time were PUTRID. Sebastian needs a reality check and needs to purchase a pair of pants. I think it's safe to say that all the employees there need one (everyone else was wearing pants). If you want to get a sick burger go to the OLD HOMESTEAD. The Kobe burger is sick. It is expensive but you will get your money's worth and get GREAT service. You also won't probably wait 2  1/2 hours to be seated. 

I finally got home at 12:30am. 6 hours earlier I wish I would have ordered a burger from the Bel-Aire Diner and relaxed in my apartment in my basketball shorts for the rest of the evening.

The bloody Mary had a LOT of kick.  It was a lot of spice initially, but it disappeared just as quickly as it hit. I liked it a  lot.

I have been craving pancakes for weeks and after a bought of food poisoning my stomach was poised for a down home, good 'ol fashion big breakfast!

Pancakes, eggs, and bacon. Honestly, what more can you ask for. The food comes out astonishingly fast. Be warned, these pancakes are monsters. The hub and I can usually down any plate, but we were honestly stuffed with just 1 of the 2 ginormous pancakes. These guys are heavy yet light at the same time. I dunno how they managed that, but top them with some butter and maple syrup and these are a meal in itself. I came here for the pancakes and I was not disappointed. They hit the spot and even the pancake I had that I took home, was still the same consistently as when it came out piping hot.

"If you're looking for delicious authentic food, a fun belly dancing show, and hookah, all at the same time, THIS IS YOUR PLACE TO GO!

Service: (4/5) our waiter could've been a little more responsive, but still catered to all our needs and very fast too! 

Food: (4/5) delicious and traditional! They have a lot of appetizers that are perfectly portioned to share as well as easy to share (I highly recommend people getting their own entrees of shish kebabs and mushrooms with potatoes, with a side of Greek salad and ""cigars"" for everyone to share!) 

Price: (5/5) you can leave this place happy and full. Your wallet won't be crying after you leave this place as opposed to a night out in the city.

Alcohol: (5/5) So my friends and I have a sick obsession with Zambuka (yes the licorice liquor that you set on fire...) so we decided to go wild since we were having fun and order shots of zambuka for everyone. The bartender came to our table, just for fun (how nice!), and demonstrated a show on how to properly light and drink zambuka. Never have I ever drank zambuka like that, my world was changed after that (mind-blown) 

Overall, come here for a chill night. If you're outside and it gets chilly, you can ask for a ""Halat"" and they'll bring you an epic blanket to toss over. If you're inside, get ready for a show!",0.069398251363186725,0
"It was a misty September evening in Manhattan as I sat in the plush back seat of a town car, lulled by the sounds of the windshield wipers moving steadily like a metronome. I exited the cab and ducked into Betony, narrowly escaping the rain.
I was the first one to arrive, nearly 20 minutes early. After checking in with the hostess, I sat at the bar and took a look at my surroundings. Ornate carvings adorned the walls, motifs stretched across the vast ceiling.
***
Jack, the jovial bartender with an Australian accent, nudged me and asked if ""gin and I got along"".
I was intrigued. ""Why?"" I asked.
""Well there was a mix-up with another order and we have an extra Negroni..."" he winked.
 
***
The Negroni washed down delicious bar snacks. Thin, crispy Cabot cheddar crackers and salted bread crumbs.
 
I felt a tap on my shoulder as Sharon was the next to arrive. After ordering a delicious Palma Fizz (vodka, ginger, lime, rosewater ), we were led to our table upstairs and given the menu.
 
The menu begins with appetizers on the left, small plates in the middle and then larger entrees on the right.
 
Frank arrived and the three of us decided to order the following appetizers: foie gras bonbons, fried pickles, and chickpea panisse.
 
Michelle was the last to arrive, as a shutdown of the E train caused a 1.5 hr delay. Since we couldn't get a hold of her via phone, text, email for over an hour, we had no idea what happened to her. The atmosphere prickled with nervous anxiety, the fear of the unknown palpable. After a quick prayer, a deluge of Michelle's texts flooded our phones to our relief. To their credit, Betony's servers were patient and periodically checked up on us to make sure everything was ok.
 
With our party seated at 11pm for the 9pm resi, we hungrily devoured the foie gras bonbons which were flashed with liquid nitrogen and covered in candied cashews and crusted with black pepper. Fantastic. The fried pickles with peppers packed a little heat which cooled off with the yogurt.
 
Our server, Daniel, who used to be a sommelier at The NoMad, presented a dish, compliments of the kitchen. He knew that we were worried sick about Michelle and wanted us to enjoy our dinner. Heirloom tomato gazpacho (zebra tomatoes are green even when ripe) with frozen goat cheese sorbet showcased familiar flavors with unconventional preparation.
 
The chickpea panisse tasted like a crispy spring roll with a puree of chickpea inside. The savory ham went well with the creamy chickpea.
 
When we split the bread apart, billowing wisps of steam gave us a mini-facial. I almost dropped the bread on the floor because it burned my fingers. We immediately spread the butter on the bread and watched it melt into a small puddle. Great crust and a burst of anise-licorice essence from the caraway seeds.
 
The seared foie gras dish is a must-order. Sour collard greens, crispy kale, smooth foie with ham hock and ham consommé. Tip: With your leftover bread, sop up the last drop.
 
While we waited for our entrees, we talked about our careers. I'm always curious to hear the different work environments of my friends - to hear what works and what can be improved to increase efficiency. Frank and Sharon, both in finance, have been friends for a very long time and she still has no idea what he does for a living. (He is a product manager for mobile applications at a financial services firm). Pretty soon, the focus shifted to my job. When one asks what I do, there are many answers. Suffice it to say that I wear many hats as my firm of 50 people can be described as entrepreneurial by nature, a perfect conduit for me to take on disparate responsibilities and segue in and out of different verticals. The lack of red tape and micromanaging allows me to focus energies on the tasks at hand instead of worrying about politics and face time with senior management. As long as you get the work done, that's all that matters.
 
The plates of short ribs cut our conversation short. This dish deserves all the hype. The application of beef fat throughout the process has yielded the best short rib I have ever tasted. The fried sweetbreads provided crunch and the charred romaine helped cut through the fat.
 
I almost forgot about the second entree that I ordered, a glistening chicken roasted with chanterelles and Tokyo turnips. The perfectly crisped skin served as a protective shield for the chunk of meat as its drippings naturally mixed with the fragrant pool of chanterelles.
 
I let the hostess know ahead of time to prepare something special for Frank and Michelle to celebrate their recent engagement. Champagne foam with strawberry sorbet and pannacotta with lemon ""caviar"" (comprised of an agar and lemon reduction). The hot mixture gets plunged into a cold bath which forms small sacs that look like caviar.

"As another reviewer mentioned this is the only Seamless Indian place in Bay Ridge. I had seen the less than stellar reviews but was really craving Indian so thought maybe they were wrong. They are not and I'm so bummed because I love delivery Indian.

I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and what I got was a bowl of faded school bus yellow sauce that tasted mostly of cream and oil. The naan was not the fluffy kind I was expecting but seemed more like flour tortillas. It was literally inedible. I called them up and they sent a guy over with a new batch of the exact same crap even though I said I'd rather just a refund because I'd already warmed up leftovers because the oily cream was making me feel sick. 

I called Seamless and they contacted the restaurant that refused a refund and swore that the food was on par. Seriously? I can get better Chicken Tikka Masala from a Trader Joe's frozen meal! No thanks!

"Come on, Artichoke&#39;s! 

I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m one out of like 20 people in this city who AREN&#39;T actually impressed by Artichoke&#39;s. People seem to GLORIFY this chain like it&#39;s God&#39;s after-hours grub gift to NYC, but ... I&#39;ve had much better. I don&#39;t care how drunk I am, I&#39;d rather have a 2 Bros slice of pizza and at least I know what I&#39;m getting myself into.

And by getting myself into ... I mean, I can&#39;t be the only other person in this city who&#39;s gotten sick after a couple of slices here. And, by sick, let&#39;s just say I couldn&#39;t leave the apartment all day following my 4 AM binge eat, at least until maybe 4 or 5 pm, for fear of ACCIDENTALLY SHITTING MYSELF. I&#39;ve had Artichoke&#39;s maybe around a collective 3 or 4 times in their various locations, but for some reason, this one by Meatpacking always seems to make me want to throw myself over the Highline just to make the agonizing stomach pain go away. 

Upside is, I met John Stamos here that night -- er, morning. JOHN STAMOS aka. Uncle Jesse aka. Silver Fox aka. BE MY DADDY aka. I LOVE YOU. Extra star for that.

Random: My friend and I sat next to some Brazilian guys in town and managed to convince them that slapping a Marinara slice and an Artichoke slice together then eating them together like a sandwich was the &#34;NEW YORK&#34; thing to do. When asked why nobody else was eating their pizza the way we were, we told them that they weren&#39;t real New Yorkers. Poor guys.

Anyways... I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back for awhile. I still have that churning, nauseuous-clammy feeling in my stomach every time I make eye contact with an Artichoke&#39;s, kind of the same way I feel when think of my tool of an ex-boyfriend. Whoops!

Last night, I ordered delivery, specifying that everything needed to be vegan. They said it would be fine and, given that they have such a focus on ingredients, I thought it would be. It&#39;s not hard to do pad thai without egg -- or is it? Apparently, it&#39;s harder than I thought. The rest of the food wasn&#39;t so great, either. Even my perennially non-complaining boyfriend mentioned it as soon as our guest left.  The spring rolls, which used to be hot, juicy and delicious with mushroom flavor, are now overly noodly and not very flavorful. The green curry has also gone all boring and standard.

"Seriously, $8-$9 for a 25cl glass of beer??? People, that is 8.4 ounces which means a pint would cost 16-18 dollars. I used to visit this place all the time many years ago and would meetup with friends. It appears the owners have changed. I&#39;ve had the mussels and frites before and got sick and threw up later that evening, I think from the mussels - frites by themselves are fine though, just a bit greasy. The place is beat down inside, chairs are all assorted folding chairs near the front with some wooden tables and chairs in the midle and back. It&#39;s dimly lit but even looking beat down inside has a nice laid back dive bar vibe to it. I just can&#39;t get over their prices, I mean they have just gone insane. You get a beer and half the thing or more is foam. I don&#39;t recall that years ago and every glass back than was 33cl. I casually mentioned the abundance of foam to the asian girl serving me the drink and she told me it&#39;s &#34;Belgian Style&#34;. I know how Belgians serve the beer and yes I know they pour a big head, but my glass had both the 25cl line and the 33cl line printed on it so why couldn&#39;t they pour it to 33cl for $9??

"PLEASE. DON'T. DO IT! I've always been a crazy fan of sushi, going to different restaurants to sample and explore the amazing different rolls of sushi. Never have I sat down at an ""all you can eat"" sushi buffet and spot it empty. I have stepped inside this sushi place twice; once to pick up a menu and once to actually sit down and try their AYCE; both times only had either one customer or none. Worst way to waste 20$ is to go to this place.

Let's start with the positive:
- The place is clean and small; plates are cute and the furniture is decorative.
- Lunch AYCE is 11.99 while Dinner is 16.99. This is a dollar cheaper than Sake (which is pretty much the best known sushi buffet around bensonhurst)
- Menu is not that small; it has the basic rolls and appetizers.
- Appetizers such as the crab rangoon, which is abundant in fillings, and the fried calamari is delish. But the appetizers totally had us fooled about the sushi.

Negatives:
- Bland! Most of these things were very bland. The rolls were not horribly made, but the taste of them! I've never ate a sweet potato roll that was not sweet at all!
- Other appetizers i hated: Dry kani salad, bland chicken tempura, semi-burnt chicken katsu, Lumpy spicy tuna salad (served with a few slices of avocado)
- The best thing about sushi buffet is their unlimited sashimi. Well I could hardly eat it because it was so sluggish and slimy.. I dreaded eating another piece! I felt like I would get some sort of poisoning from this place, but I don't want to be charged for it. The salmon sashimi, especially, was shapeless and poorly cut thin. FYI I ordered about 6 sashimi and flinched at the first one.
- ATMOSPHERE? During the daytime, it is bright. During the nighttime, it is bright. There is no romantic feeling, thus bringing a date here would be foolish. The (one) TV played a chinese acrobatic show that slowed my mood down even more. 
- CUSTOMER SERVICE? Had there been a good waitress, I would perhaps give it a 2/5. Yet the waitress was the only one working in the front with the chef. She hardly says anything, no smiles, no nothing. She and the sushi chef constantly returned to the back to the restaurant, leaving us to feel like the only ones there. (we were technically the only ones there except for another couple). But it made me wonder how long it would take them to realize if someone were to dine-and-ditch. (of course I'd never do it, but their method of running a business is just ridiculous)

LISTEN TO THE OTHER REVIEWS. I ignored that this place has a 2.5 rating; my big mistake and my punishment is a stomachache. I predict this place won't last long at all, and I feel bad to say that about someone's business. Get better staff, workers and redecorate! It's not in a horrible location to begin with. 

P.S. I found a fish scale in my spicy tuna roll. It happens occasionally with other places, but this does not help my first impression.",0.020084048359481577,0
"Arrghhh. I so badly want to give this place 5 stars. At the same time I want to give it 1 star. Before you stone me, let me explain!

The food here is OUTSTANDING. I had chicken over rice that was perfectly cooked and ridiculously flavorful. Five stars by any normal account. While waiting on line they even gave us a free piece of falafel. You will never find a crispier falafel anywhere. The only con to it was that it was actually on the dry side.

Why the minus stars?
They&#39;re freakin&#39; -filthy-! 
Dude. I don&#39;t give a damn about eating food off a street cart, or tamales made by some old Spanish lady&#39;s bare hands, or rice cakes cooked by some Chinese woman in a store front that&#39;s the size of my closet. That&#39;s normally great, authentic, culturally rich food. And I&#39;ve eaten some very questionable food in my time. I was raised Filipino, where i learned to &#34;pick off the bad parts and eat the rest.&#34; My stomach may not be totally made of iron, but I can handle food from a place the Dept. of Health would rate a C (you can get away with a lot and still get an A/B, I worked in the food bizz for a few years).

The problem here is that none of these dudes changed their gloves once. I saw them stick their hands in raw falafel mix, handle cash money, and the -worst- offense, handle a filthy garbage container covered in wet rancid scrap-food mess to dump it into the nasty C-town dumpster a few yards away. AND NEVER CHANGED THEIR GLOVES. And then! stick their hands in a basket of cooked falafel to hand it as samples to people waiting on line! Wtf!

I didn&#39;t finish my chicken platter the night I got it because:
a) It was very filling and
b) I was busy peeing out of my ass after eating it.

BUT. Just to convey how delicious the food was, I STILL ate some of the left overs the next day because:
a) It was delicious
b) Someone stole my lunch at work and I didn&#39;t eat anything all day.

Famished, I risked it a second time. Yes, stupid, my fault, and like damn clockwork I found myself pooping out everything I just consumed. On the plus side, this could be a really great diet. You get to eat amazing food and dump it all out before your body gets to absorb any calories. 

Seriously, if it wasn&#39;t for their complete lack of hygienic practices, this place would easily be five stars.
Come here if you like the combination of tasty street food and playing the exhilarating game of seeing how long you can hold your diarrhea before crapping your pants.

All of their seafood and mushroom dishes are sprinkled with sand, which unpleasantly crunches between the teeth. Their ice cream is usually never frozen and the Jell-O is dusty. Most dishes are either chipped or still dirty with a prior diner&#39;s meal leftovers. 

Parents, beware -- the servers and manager are NOT kid-friendly!

I generally avoid this place because it is so overpriced, even by Manhattan standards. Today I ran in because Trader Joe's was out of no fat cottage cheese and I hoped to pick some up on my way home.

I head downstairs, found the cottage cheese. As I was going to check the nutrition info on the back, I noticed the expiration date. October 14th. Today is October 27th. I checked all the other nonfat cottage cheeses, same thing.

I sought out an employee to let them know. I approached the first (and only) person I saw with a ""Food Emporium"" logo on their shirt and said ""Excuse me..."" and was cut off by her saying ""I'M NOT ON THE CLOCK YET"" and walking away, refusing to listen to a word I said.

"Alrighty. I've never been a burger fan. It just doesn't excite me the idea of a ground meat patty laying in bed between two breads, pour special sauce on it, put the blanket of lettuce and tomato and call it lunch and/dinner.  And be hungry 30 mins later. 

But then I see this undying long lines everytime I passed Madison Square Park and then I learned about this whole world of Burger as a culinary art. It peaked my curiosity,  not my appetite.  so I have been postponing to try this place until my friend dragged me in a bitter cold of November to join the casuality of that long line and the war over tables & chairs. To be honest, the line moves quickly and with patience one can find a table. It ain't starbucks. People will leave after devouring those monsters. 

Ordered Shack Stack (a burger with the meat & the portobello mushroom) so I can taste both worlds. Friend ordered one with bacon and fries with cheese. Verdict: great hangover food - its fatty, salty, fatty, & salty. And I guess NYC must-eat at. Once.

The deep-fried mushroom is crunchy & has a cheese inside. Just imagine my horror:
 Cheese = Salt = poor my kidneys. *jug on water for a week. Nothing special with the Fries & Cheese. Use the $3.25 to add an extra meat patty. The meat is thin and I personally ordered it rare; why no med-rare!!! I'm afraid medium becomes well-done. Overcook meat = hard&dry meat. Not good. Me a lazy chewer. T'was a burger experience.

"WARNING: My friend got food poisoned from their lobster.

I wonder if the chef was on his leave because my experience was beyond disappointing. 

We each ordered a $94 four course menu and got one appetizer, one pasta, one main course, and one dessert. 

Appetizer - Foie gras. The portion was almost too large for a first course that it killed the dish's delicacy. The caramelized onions on top was too sweet to swallow. It covered foie gras' freshness and fragrance (or maybe it was just not there without the onions). I'm a foie gras lover but this was too greasy for me to finish the plate. 

Pasta - Trofie Nero. Seriously what's the hype with this pasta? It was too salty and had a texture of uncooked flour dough. I can get squid ink pasta way better in taste and half in price. 

Main course - Steak. The steak was just decent, nothing impressive to please my taste bud. But an average dish was good enough to be the star of the night. 

My friend gave me a bite of her lobster and I sensed a fishy smell. Her stomach felt really weird on her way home, followed by a rough time in the bathroom. BEWARE OF THEIR SEAFOOD.

Dessert - We picked 6 different desserts. They were either too sweet or too bland. The pear gelato was probably the best one because it tasted like pears.

Service - One server mixed our orders so my friend and I had to exchange our pastas by our own hands.

The overall experience was painful and disgusting.The soup was bland and was not cooked long enough that all the ingredients tasted raw and the liquid was gooey. The scallion pancakes were OK but did not have enough flavor to them. The mapo tofu was delicious and the tofu tasted fresh. The worst dish was the sauteed aromatic shrimp which was mouth numbing experience. The color of the dish was brown and looked over cooked. My boyfriend and I were so hungry at that point thatwe decided to give it a go. The minute we ate this our mouths started to go numb and the taste was as if they had poured gasoline in the dish. I understand some of it might be the spice but I've had enough Sichuan style food that I know what it should taste like. After we ate this, our bodies started to tingle and we felt nausea for about 4 hours. I looked up these symptoms and it's the case of over using MSG. There was SO MUCH MSG used in this dish that my body had a reaction to it instantaneously. I called the restaurant and the lady was nice enough to credit us but what rubbed me the wrong way was that she insisted that it was my first time trying this dish and that I had nothing to compare it by. I've let her know that I've had enough Sichuan food to understand the deeply rooted flavors but nothing should numb the mouth and gives your body a nauseous reaction.

"""I'm writing this review the morning after having foodswings for dinner - right after I needed to call-in sick to work.

I will say I went to this establishment about two years ago and remember really liking the food. Back then, I had a burger and shake and both were delicious. Last night's food however, was not like anything I remember. As the reviewer said below, the food is way over priced for what you end up getting. I ordered the cowboy burger and was given a stale bun with tasteless, messy seitan. The only enjoyable part of the burger was the fake bacon, which having been a vegetarian for almost 9 years I'm usually not a fan of, but the bacon was the only flavorful part of the burger. 

The service was eh. I get that the vibe is supposed to be somewhat pompous so went in expecting that, but don't go in here thinking people are going to want to serve you. 

As mentioned, the morning after foodswings has not been pleasant. I would give it one star, but I do like the fact that it is a pure vegan establishment. Now only if it tasted better...""",0.030798304030255262,0
There are times in life when you've had a meal at a restaurant and you wonder at which point during that evening you are going to get sick. That's the only way I can describe the experience I had eating here. They give away 25 dollar dinner certificate and no need to wonder why. The salsas are bland and awful (one is made of mayo!!!! Yak!). I ordered the snapper and it was not fresh and had a greasy film. I thought I was going to have food poisoning. My partner ordered the churrasco which was a complete joke- tiny in portion. After closing out our bill the waiter added 17% gratuity since we had a 25 dinner card. Incredible gall of these ppl. The bartender placed two drinks in front of me for the two for one specials. When I asked if he could wait bc maybe I'd wanted to try another flavored Cosmo he said it was policy to serve two simultaneously. Furthermore he told me that he would but the owner would get very angry one him. Te owner is a real douche sitting around counting money. Imbecile. Never again. In fact id be surprised if they last another 6 months.,0.048869513907002539,0

"I live in the neighborhood and have been to veggies several times.  The juice has always been just OK.  They don't use the freshest vegetables and fruit and none of it is organic so, like other reviewers, I'm not sure why the prices are so high.  

This leads me to my next point--that the last time I went, I'm sure that I got FOOD POISONING from their juice.  I had a juice with spinach and kale in it.  I knew I should have been more careful when I saw the guy putting some browning spinach leaves into the blender.  The juice wasn't even that great and within a few hours I was throwing up.  I'm very health conscious and aware of my body so I know that this juice is definitely the culprit, I had been feeling fine and not really eaten much else that day.

For sushi, I always get the Tuna special dish - $55.  You get a spicy tuna roll and 10 pieces of specially prepared, different taste profile tuna sushi.  This dish is friggin awesome!!!  My only gripe with this dish is one time the waiter was pointing to each piece explaining what it was and his finger was really close to touching each piece - made me a little nervous

"The worst vegetarian food! Ever. No, come think of it - the worst food ever - vegetarian or carnivorous. 
Every food option looked, tasted and smelled like a bad Chinese takeout that sat in the fridge since last week (which given the disastrous food, most likely was).
For a place that pretends to be vegetarian,  they sure have no respect for plant food. The green beens looked so old and sad, we opted for lo main and quinoa instead. Quinoa was horribly undercooked and stale, while looking lomain was horribly overcooked and stale. Drumsticks were dripping in oil and tasted like tar, while fake chicken was tasteless. 
We decided against their overpriced juices with appetizing names like ""Diahrea"" and ""Constipation "". You are practically guaranteed to experience both if you decide to risk eating the castle food. All they are missing is a drink called ""Vomiting "", which is how you will feel every time you think of this place.
Even vegans would have healthier and more appetizing choices in another castle - the White Castle! 
Given the horrible food, high prices and the fact that the guy behind the counter spoke almost no English,  the place deserves -1 star. But because of yelp limitations and because the place is actually nice looking and a bathroom is clean, a very generous +1 star. 
Btw, while we were there, a couple walked in from the street using another door, and they brought with them takeout from another eatery. Smart!

"I wish I could give this place zero stars. My dad and I were meeting for a quick bite to eat super early in the morning on a Sunday, prior to a shuttle ride to the airport. You would be surprised how many places in this area are closed early Sunday morning that won't give you food poisoning. 

So my dad and I were excited to find a semi-decent looking place that could meet our needs. Except for the fact that this place did not meet our needs, in fact it left us standing on the streets of New York at 7:00am needing to reroute our morning plans because Liberty Diner doesn't feel the need to update their website to the fact that they are not open ""7am-2am Everyday!"" as cleverly advertised on their website.

When I called to question this later in the evening I was told they ""eventually planned to be open at 7am, and that they open at 11am"" Why is this not updated on the website? I ask. ""Ohh we did the paperwork"" I don't know what that means, but what I do know is that if you are not open at 7am, you sure as hell should not be advertising that you are. If they don't care enough about posting the correct dining times on-line, that speaks volumes as to how much they care about the customers, food, and service. 

Liberty Diner take some responsibility and change your times, and advertising. This is literally the equivalent to a 200 pound person, saying that they are 100 pounds and then, when they are questioned on it saying one day they plan on losing 100 pounds, so in the mean time they are telling everyone they are only 100 pounds.

Sesame bagel with walnut cream cheese (good choice Ken G!)
Pumperknickel raisin with plain cheese
Cinnamon raisin with blueberry cream cheese

"There are so many reasons why I dislike FiDI, the biggest one being the fact that the lunch choices are so lackluster.  Thanks to Dig Inn, I now have another one to add to the list.

I was stuck at work on a Sunday and was perusing my options.  I had never ordered from here before, and the reviews on here and seamless were good, so I gave them a try.  This is what I got:

- Lemon Chicken
- Braised Beef 
- Un-Fried Veggie Rice
- Grilled Summer Veggies
- String Beans w/ Potatoes
- Spinach & Strawberry Salad
- Roasted Red Pepper w/ Toasted Almonds (salad dressing)

Delivery time was an hour, give or take, and I had to call them -- not okay.  Then, the delivery guy calls me and tells me he is downstairs, so I take the elevator down 40+ flights, walk to the lobby, go outside, and still have to wait for him.  Listen, I get that delivery people don't like to wait for you to stroll down to get your food, but never had I been made to wait that long.

Anyway, the bag is soggy because the sauce and heat made the cardboard container damp, which leaked through to the paper bag.  While I was happy my food wasn't in styrofoam, I had to put paper towels down on my desk as a placemat.

Now, onto the portions: I had ordered the large plate, with an additional side of meat, for an additional fee.  Is it wrong for me to assume that I would get a large plate of my original order, PLUS a separate side of meat??  Instead, what I got was everything I ordered crammed into one continuous container, with the flavors of thing x melding into the juices of y and z.   Oh, and the container ain't that big to begin with, lemme tell ya.  ""$16+ for this?!  Really??"" I wondered, as I stared at my plate (I really wish I had the container to give you dimensions, but think 3/4 of a macbook air).  Not only that, if I didn't pay extra for the braised beef, I would have gotten that amount in the chicken, no?  I would have rather not paid more for some beef (which was too sweet, anyway), and gotten the same amount of food with just chicken.  (Speaking of which, I was imagining a breaded chicken francese-type dish, but it was just chunks of skinless breast that was soaked in lemon juice.  Not bad, but nothing spectacular.)

Now, onto my major problem.  Okay, so fine; I was willing to write the experience off as whatever, since the food was a little better than mediocre, and like I said, my standards for FiDi are low.  HOWEVER, this place made me sick.  Like, literally sick.  Someone in a previous review mentioned they got food poisoning from it, but I chalked it up to a random incident.  WRONG.  Sparing everyone the gross details, I was sick for two days straight with an upset stomach.  I had ordered the dressing to use on a salad later, but ended up tossing it.  

One plus, though.  You could tell they used quality ingredients like they went shopping at the farmer's market (which, reading the above, sounds like an oxymoron, I know).  Judging by the other positive reviews, maybe I was just unlucky, but know this -- I thought that, too, when I read the other food poisoning review.  If ordering from here, realize that it may be a gamble.",0.023543924625365246,0
"I discovered this place after I started working in Chelsea and i was looking for a less corporate go-to coffee shop for my morning caffeine kick. It didn&#39;t take long for me to get addicted to their selection of coffees and baked muffins leading to me getting their lunch sandwiches as well. After frequenting the cafe more than 13 times within 10 business days I encountered my first MOLDY MUFFIN! The worst part is, the mold was forming on the bottom rim of the muffin and because I was eating it from the top, I didn&#39;t notice until I was midway through! In Shock, I brought the other half back to the cafe and even the cashier was stunned after I showed her! She apologized and in the midst of the moment (she may have been struck by stupidity) but asked me if I wanted another muffin rather than a refund. I&#39;m not the type of person to make a scene so I kindly declined and got my money back.
I was so upset over this incident, not so much about the mold (since it did not make me sick) but because their food tasted SOOOOOOOOOO good and now I didn&#39;t feel like I could trust their quality.
I waited approximately 1 week and couldn&#39;t resist the urge any longer...I decided to go back and get their parmesian eggplant sandwich. If this visit had no issues I definitely would still go there, but it may have been a coincidence where the large piece of cheese on my sandwich looked as though there were little white/clear fuzzy things on it! I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES! I asked my co-worker to look at it confirming it was mold! I really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and believe it was pieces of the wax paper stuck to the cheese, but wax paper just doesn&#39;t leave that type of fuzzy residue.

"I recently went to an event at Barclays with some friends and walked out starving.  Most of the Park Slope restaurants are closed by 11:30.  I&#39;d been to 200 5th a few years ago and it was solid.  Good beer selection, solid bar food.  

The recent experience was nothing like the past ones.  First round of beers comes, one is skunked.  It happens, I think nothing of it.  Waitress is totally cool with letting a change happen.  Different beer comes, it&#39;s skunked again!  

Honey wings, very good.  Since I can&#39;t give this experience 0 stars, the honey wings are reason for a star.  

The entrees ordered should have been layups.  Burger, turkey burger and grilled cheese.  It&#39;s not like we ordered the fish and chicken cordon bleu.  I ate the burger because I&#39;m a dude and I was starving, but I was praying for no food poisoning when I got home.  The meat tasted old.  The bun was dry and tasteless.  It was so horrible that I removed the burger/cheese/veggies and ate it separately.  I should have sent everything back but at this point it would have been a pointless exercise.  I just needed to get out of there.

The curly fries were average, not bad.  Friend got onion rings on the side, decent also.   

I&#39;m disappointed by experience here.  It&#39;s a great setup for a game.  I&#39;d say if you are going here get the wings and beer on bottle to keep it simple and safe.",0.060711448990709606,0
"I thought I already reviewed this place many times over. Go figure.

FIVE STARS FOR FOOD. Well, maybe 4.5, but the most of the food is good, nicely cooked, and nicely presented. I didn&#39;t happen to like the stuffed squid that a lot of people rave about, but for me, bbq squid taste is not the best paired with kind of kani salad stuffing. Sushi are surprisingly good, special kinds more so - and not at all expensive. Awesome beef negimaki. Best satay chicken ramen. Some good desserts.
FOUR STARS FOR SETTING. Small place literally stuffed with tables, there is even a littlest table imaginable in the corner by the door where the umbrella  stand used to be. Not awful, but when it&#39;s crowded.. it&#39;s c r o w d e d!
THREE STARS FOR PATCHY SERVICE. If you are lucky to get a good server (in person or on the phone), you&#39;re in for a great experience. If today is not your day, well, your food may come out late, or not done as you wanted, - or not at all.
ZERO STARS FOR CHIPMUNK FRONT DESK GIRL! She is always curt, never a smile or a howareyou / haveaniceday,  always giving attitude... She starts inventing rules on the spot, like that you can only get a 3 roll special when dining in - when it&#39;s not said anywhere in the menu or in restaurant, and we ordered it to go or to be delivered several times and never had an issue. I asked to have fried banana dessert to go (comes with a bit of green tea ice cream), she refused - because ice cream may melt! I asked why is it any business of hers if I want to eat my dessert outside, she said what if I go home, put melted dessert in the freezer, eat it then, and get food poisoning and return to complain? OK, so I am complaining here about her lack of service or basic customer service skills; don&#39;t see how it is better. If they have such a strict policy (which I doubt) of no ice cream to go, why not offer to make just the fried bananas to go? I would&#39;ve agreed, since you can get green tea ice cream in a store next door, and they don&#39;t care what happens to your food after it&#39;s paid for. LONGEVOUSJOY MANAGEMENT, if you read this, please do yourselves a favor and put someone else, more customer-friendly, in charge of client greeting and takeout / delivery orders?! Pretty please, with some unmelted green tea ice cream on top!

Bottom line, if you are here, have some spare time, and want to eat at a good spot - come in! If you want a to-go order or delivery... think twice, and try calling back if you hear a female voice.",0.0066317807296751834,0

The  baked scotcht egg and the baby crab cakes are great appetizers or just to have a nosh. This true gastro pub offers great British fare, I particularly love the salads --the King George being my favorite-- and the &#34;Guvnor&#34; sandwich. The Yorkshire Pudding is to die for. If you love desert, you cannot miss the Pears on Port wine. This jewel is more than a bar and is very reasonable. I suggest you make it your hang our even if you do not live in the hood.

"*Review for delivery ONLY*

I can't speak to the actual service at the sit down restaurant, but damn they're fast with their delivery.  The General Tsao's I ordered (not very Chinese I know) was surprisingly pretty weak; too many peppers, bland chicken, and sauce that was sickeningly sweet... I could barely get through it... but the dim sum that was delivered was great!  

The pork buns were more like pork bun bites (or vitamins almost) and were nice and fluffy, with a sweet and savory chunk of pork in the middle.  The chicken feet though were the best though; if they screwed this part up, it would've been a minus few stars.  A bunch of chicken feet in a sticky black bean sauce... so good, falling of the bone.  And the dim sum prices are extremely reasonable.

Dim sum for delivery is definitely the way to go here.",0.036407432530636268,0

"When I use to think of salad bars I use to think of getting food poisoning at Ruby Tuesday.  Them I moved to New Jack City and experienced some of the corner bodegas making fresh salads as you choose the toppings. Then I tried chop't, tossed, Just Salad and Sweet Greens as I am always eating a healthy lunch. 

All those roads led me down this path to the Mecca of salad customization. Their dressings are delicious, their proteins are all fresh, filled with flavor and nutrition.  I actually laugh at the selection at the other places... Fried chicken at chop't? Disgusting. You can tell all of the meats and half of the other toppings at the chain locations are prepared so that they can be dispersed from one location and last in the fridge for up to 14 days!  Gross who in their right mind wants to eat that.  

I can feel the nutrients coursing through my veins as I finish the salad now.  Quit having a boring salad, quit having a boring life. 

Spinach and kale, tuna, falafel, grilled kale, roasted carrots, jalepenos, fresh onion, pumpkin seeds, cherry tomatoes, avocado, quinoa, Bulgarian feta. Miso carrot ginger dressing. 

Who makes these dressings?  My mind is blown.",0.016563194132792326,0
"This place is a dump.  While they are renovating they are trying to conduct business as usual.  Later at night they have workman sheet rocking and plastering right over your food, with minimal protection to the food stuff.  Last night a man was plastering a wall directly over the bakery items with barely a sheet of plastic covering the food items.  In another aisle, the entire floor was being drilled at in an effort to lift off the old tiles.  Dust and other debris was all over the place.  But forget the renovation... This store is always a dirty place.  And while I've been shopping here for years, I'm staring to get real concerned abou the safety of the food in this place.  A few weeks ago, I purchased a Marie Calendar's pie for 10.00 and found when I took it home it was a mess - it obviously sat on a hand truck waiting to be unpacked and put in the freezer for quite some time.  I'm concerned about all the pre sliced (in store sliced) meats and cheeses in one of the coolers where the stuff looks like its been sitting a bit to long.  Everything in this store is a dirty mess.

"I just got home and showered and can't contain myself. This is the best sandwich that I have ever split with one of my best friends in my LIFE! AHHHHHHHHHHH! I WANT TO LIVE IN BROOKLYN SUB. No joke. The only things you need to know is that they can put almost anything you want on to a sandwich for a ridiculously cheap amount of money and that they turn off their grills by 6pm. I almost don't even know what the hell we got because Ingrid hasn't really eaten in like 2-3 days from stress. BUT Zaneta I think got a sub sandwich with sesame seed bun with jerk turkey or smoked jerk turkey of some sorts with jack cheese, tomato, lettuce, tiny bit of mayo, vinegar & oil, and jalapenos. Lots of freaking jalapenos. And I got another beer and plopped down and poured that dog fish head into a styrofoam cup. I say that I can live here because they have everything you could ever want and bare with me I have a photogenic memory: toilet paper, towels, advil, sanitary pads, cat/dog food, fresh fruit!, mixers, amy's soup, oreos, amy's organic bunny & the parmesan mac & cheese, gold fish crackers, ramen noodles, kraft dinner, cereals, organic cookies, chips ahoy, pepperidge farm, those hazelnut pieruette twirl cookies you dip in coffee that are amazing, a million kinds of chips/nuts: including party mix with both sun chips, dorritos & cheetos.

"So, this is the best proper taco/Mexican place in the NYU area. All that pretentious fusion or Chinese Mexican food can shove it. The guys who work here are wicked nice and work super fast when they need to. 

That said, I don&#39;t think that I have ever had a taco from this place. I have only eaten their tortas, cemitas, burritos, and tamales. The tortas here are superlative. They are super moist and juicy. I usually get the veggie torta, and it really cannot be beat. I also had the lengua before, which was pretty good as well. Tortas are my go-to in all Mexican restaurants, and these are amongst the best. I live in a Mexican neighborhood and the tortas here are generally not as good. 

The tamales are a superb value. For two dollars you get almost an entire lunch. I think that the burritos, especially the veggie ones, can be a bit on the lame side. The cemitas are good, but I prefer the tortas. 

All in all, if you are hankering for Mexican food around NYU, then this place is an excellent option (Dos Torros gave my friend food poisoning right before finals, so beware). Ain&#39;t no reason to go to Chipotle if the real deal exists, and this is the real deal.",0.028618506063785423,0

They gave you HUGE lobster.. not the lobster chunk.. like what you will get from a lobster roll.. except that this portion fills me up for a meal.. The soup wasn't like regular miso base.. It tasted really ""creamy"" and ""heavy"".. Seems like the boiled it with lobster.. I like it.. but a little tasteless.. or maybe I was sick, I just can't really taste it?? 
- salmon crepe: My friend love salmon so she ordered the salmon crepe.. It's cute.. but just a small piece of salmon (I think lobster ramen is more worth the order).. and it was ok..

They have interesting cocktails like bloody samurai, yuzu mimosa, FR Sangria.. they don't have sangria that day so we both ordered Yuzu mimosa.. classic cocktail drinks..

"At some point on St Patty&#39;s, after stumbling around from Woodside and down Skillman Ave, my friends and I continued to stumble all the way into Bar 43.  It was starting to get late in the day, and as such, it was time to order some food.  Nobody was in the mood for full dinners, so we ordered some apps, a plate of fries, some mozzarella sticks, and wings.

Bar 43 has some interesting names for their wings, relating to how spicy they are.  I would recommend that you exercise some caution here.  The people who eat the spiciest food in our groups, the Jamaican hot peppers and African shrimp had a hard time with the abusive wings.  And that isn&#39;t even the hottest available, or the second hottest.   These really need to be called Chris Brown wings for people to get the point.  I can&#39;t imagine what the Nuclear and Suicidal wings are like. 

So, after discovering this place, my girlfriend and I decided to come back.  There are many choices for burgers infused with Guiness, and as I had thought, anything with Guiness simply tastes that much better.  If you&#39;re not interested in that, the menu has decent variety with some great creativity.

This is not the Ollie's that used to be near Times Square. I am not sure how they are using the same name. The environment itself is pleasant and well decorated with friendly staff but the food is far from being pleasant. The scallion pancakes were dripping in oil which is amazing as even over local Chinese restaurant does a better job with them. The dumplings were good but the cumin lamb was almost inedible as it had about 10 times as much cumin as it needed.  We are used to eating all kind of spicy food from all kind of nationalities and we cook all kind of spicy food ourselves plus my background is Indian. Trust me this was bad. The beef and noodle soup was tasteless. So i put one tiny piece of the cumin lamb in the soup and it flavored the entire dish with cumin. At least then I could it eat it.

Each of us ended up getting the chocolate Fro yo, expecting normal chocolate flavors. We each tried it and all thought it tasted off. We asked the employee. One tried it and agreed it was indeed bad. To me it tasted rotten. To the employee ""the mix didn't stir in."" There was one other employee working who refused to taste it because of how awful it sounded when we described if. 

Neither if the employees made any effort to make this up. Aside from offering us more of the same bad Fro yo. Yuck. I'm already going to be sick from what I tried, why would I take more? 

We ended up leaving fully unsatisfied. Another customer walked in as we were leaving and was about to order the chocolate. I couldn't believe it but the employees  were actually going to still sell it.  I told the new customer and once I did that, the employee wrote "" out of order"" on the sign.

I told her that it was a mistake because we ordered a small plate. I saw her speak to Zenobia about it, but no changes were made. How are we as first time patrons to know the difference between a small and regular sized plate to tell the server before the check comes?

We normally just order a bunch of appetizers and tomato soup and of course a bottle of wine or a couple of drinks. This is one of the only places were I really enjoy ordering drinks! But lately no matter what I order I am disappointed. I might just have grown tired of the menu because I am here a lot, or they are doing sometime different. 

They still get four stars from be because I still recommend it to all my friends. So if you are looking for a laid back place to share something small and have some drinks this is definitely the place....

...Or if you are just craving tomato soup, because that is yummy no matter how sick I am of everything else on the menu.",0.016206300726695651,0
"I first tried Patricia's when it was located further down East Tremont and I got sick because of the food. Went back a few times (I thought  just because I got sick the first time doesn't mean I should write the restaurant off) and I was never impressed with the food. Tried the food when they moved to the new location and my son got sick so I stopped going to the restaurant. My office has ordered from Patricia's a few times but I always avoided the food until recently. My office ordered from Patricia's a couple of weeks ago and I had a plate. The food was decent so last night, after a long day i decided to give them another shot and I am glad I did. I ordered the tuscano calamari, the fioretti boscaiola and the rib eye. Everything was delicious, I was so impressed! I don't know if they've changed chefs or what but I will be eating here again.",0.088302227639573308,0

"This place was packed solid when we went there on a Saturday night - you could tell a lot of Romanian families go there dressed up for a night out.  

The appetizers (salad and fried cheese) were ok, and they basically gave you a whole loaf of bread for the table.  The entrees looked amazing when they came out - my mother-in-law got a stewed chicken leg with polenta, my husband got a skinless sausage with fries, and I got the Romanian stew with polenta (one side had cheese topping and the other had a fried egg).

Unfortunately, just like several other previous reviews, my Romanian stew was cold.  Not just ""it got cold"" from sitting out - it was obviously from frozen/refrigerated and heated up by microwave.  The flavor was actually REALLY good, but after 3-4 steaming hot bites, the meat in the middle was literally ice cold.  I had them bring it back to reheat.  They obviously just put the whole plate in the microwave, as when it came back, the cheese was totally melted/rubberized on the polenta and the egg was practically hard boiled/rubberized as well.  I took another few bites and it was the same thing:  one bite was piping hot, and the next was lukewarm at best.  I gave up and just ate the polenta and egg - and the egg had an egg shell in it!!

At this point I just had to stop altogether.... I'm just glad I didn't get sick.  I really wish I could have given this place a better review, as everyone else had a great entree.  The service was ok and they were apologetic about the cold stew, but this is obviously an ongoing problem and food poisoning waiting to happen.  As an experienced microwaver, all I have to say is this:  stir the food around halfway through microwaving and it will be fine. 

Otherwise, it was decently priced for a good selection of food.  Also, they don't take AMEX.",0.035129312956286712,0

"I know this place gets a mix of reviews, but hubby and I have been coming here for a few years now and we've never had a bad experience.  I normally order the raw steak pho, but I've also ordered the tofu salad, the appetizer sampler and the lettuce wrap dish.  I service is fast and consistent.  When we go at our usual time, they always remember us and are very friendly.  Bottom line, this is a great spot for consistent and cheap pho, especially if you find yourself in K-town late night, which we often have.  I have a very weak stomach and am very susceptible to food poisoning, but I have NEVER gotten sick here, the countless times I have eaten their food.

I am disappointed in the ambience and the fact that the ladies room has been in the same state of relative disrepair for all the years we've been going.  They can definitely step up their game, but I am giving them a 4 instead of a 3 because they have never let me down!",0.1730033588200664,0

The service is extremely professional, and the food, while not phenomenal, is good. My lamb looked like it was severely undercooked. I usually get my steaks rare, but I didn't know if eating lamb this rare was safe. I ate it anyway, and it was moist, tender, and quite tasty. That was last night and I'm not sick yet, so yay! Overall a good experience, except at the end of our meal we felt really rushed. They wanted to herd us out quickly to make room for the next guests.

"My two friends and I went to the Mezcal&#39;s in Bay Ridge.  The food was fine, service was fine, the singer was annoying as hell to me, and we also dealt with an annoying drunk person next to us.  I got over the singer and the drunk.  We were in a good mood.  Another waiter wrote our check.  My friend was checking  the bill and noticed a service fee for about $17.85.  We asked our original waiter what is this for he, said that they add tips to checks over $100 dollars.  That rule is not printed on menu.  Basically that waiter decided to back up his racist co-worker.  Our check for 3 of was under $100.  I decided to ask the white family of 4, next to us to see their check, it was over $100 and no service fee was added.  Their waiter claimed he was busy and he knew them.    We showed the family our check and they were as shocked as we were.  The ignorant, racist, theft, waiter quickly took back the check and wrote a new one.   Racism is alive and real at Mezcal&#39;s  in Bay Ridge.  He decided that three well educated African Americans were not going to tip.  He makes me sick.   I suggest if you go there double check your  bill the waiter may decide that too don&#39;t know about tipping.  We decided not to tip and reward their racist ways.

"On our way to Jackson Hole, my buddies and I decided to try out this place. At first glance the place seems nice. The waiter greeted us and was friendly. After being seated we quickly asked us if we would like to order drinks. He then recommended some apps to us. We decided to order the Fried Calamari (big mistake!) and rack of ribs. My friends ordered a filet sandwich, hot pinwheel sausage and a cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. I decided to order a chili dog without cheese and a Philly cheese steak. 

When our order finally arrive, which did take that long. Honestly, if and I mean &#34;IF&#34; the food was great, the wait would be worth it. This was not one of those situations. So our calamari arrives and I can see the disappointment in my friends eye as well as mine. It looks like something you can easily buy from the freezer of a market. It tasted rough and spoiled. Definitely not fresh. One word to describe it was disgusting! 

We finally got our entries and they were not presented well. It looks like someone took a jump-shot from the free-throw line and shot an air ball onto the plate. SPLAT!!! It was just messy, over drenched in oil, and most of all, tasted nasty. My chili dog with out cheese had an abundance of cheese and the actual hot dog was no where to be found. Basically, a sloppy joe on a hoagie. My chees steak looked okay as best, compared to the rest of the dishes. But was had absolutely no flavor, overcooked and extremely dry. I asked for hot sauce in my attempt to bring some flavor to my horrible choices in picking his place. But my hotsauce and refill was no where to be found until I asked for it a third time. 

My friends order of ribs was also okay at best. No flavor, just burnt. If you want good ribs, go to BLUE SMOKE. The filet sandwich is pretty much a glorified roast beef sandwich with brunt onions smothered on top. The cheeseburger had a weird looking mushroom which was most definitely not fresh. Not even out the can. It seems like it had been sitting out for a long time. It completely oxidized and turned black (wasn&#39;t cooked). The burger was also the size of a McDonald&#39;s hamburger. And I don&#39;t mean a big mac. I mean a happy meal size burger.

Right after taking some bites out of our dishes, one of my friends and I felt nausea. Both of us are athletes and take care of our bodies quite well and are also foodies and can usually handle all types of food. Yet this horrendous meal made both of us sick. I had massive diarrhea from their chilidog and calamari. My other friend only took a few bites out of his burger and could not force himself to eat such trash, and this guy usually eats fast food.   

So I went to the counter to ask for change for the waiters tip. The manager in his fake Gucci cap was just leaning on a counter on his phone. Once i got his attention he asked how was our meal. I politely asked, &#34;Would you like the honestly truth?&#34; He said yes, so i told him. This was not good. I had higher expectations for this place and I was disappointed at almost everything. He gave me a stare down like, WHO THE YOU THINK YOU ARE? lol and said, &#34;that&#39;s the first time anyone has said that.&#34; He said all his customers love their Philly cheesesteak. So I asked, have you been to Philly? Obviously, these establishments knows nothing about food and health.

SERVICE: 5 OUT OF 10, why? Only one server for the entire floor. Forgot out order of pinwheel which he recommended.

DRINKS: 10 OUT OF 10, why? Its fucking soda if you get that wrong, go fucking shoot yourself.

APPETIZERS: 2 OUT OF 10, why? Not fresh, appealing nor tasty. 

ENTRIES: 1 OUT OF 10, why? Not edible. Made us sick.

DESSERT: ??? Didn&#39;t want to die. Even the waiter said, &#34;I&#39;m guessing you guys don&#39;t wanna order any dessert, huh? 

LOCATION, 8 OUT OF 10, why? It&#39; located in a nice area with plenty of people who have money and are welling to pay for this over price shit hole of a restaurant/grill. Easy to find roadside parking.",0.15726898187935626,1
"Easily the worst meal I've had on the island in 35 years.  Their tomato sauce is horrible.  We got it on ravioli and it tasted like they just opened a can of tomato sauce added no spices or salt and served it.  Then with the fried calamari I got ""fra diavlo"" sauce which was the same exact tomato sauce,  this time with Tabasco sauce... again with no flavor at all. I took my calamari home and I'll open a jar of Rao's fra diavlo sauce. My daughter had linguine with clan sauce which she didn't eat also because she said it tasted like it came out of a jar... I want even that lucky.

"I have been to empire biscuit 3 times over its short life. A lot of waiting around for inconstant biscuits:

1. Eat your biscuit immediately because they don't keep well - On a Thursday morning I got a butter and grape jam on country biscuit for me and arugula fennel butter country biscuit for my coworker. No line for ordering and it took between 5 - 10 minutes for me to get 2 fresh out of the oven. Ate mine on the walk to the subway and it was delicious. My coworker was out sick so I ate her's an hour later and it was gross. The biscuit dried out and had no taste.

2. This place cannot handle lines, go for the all butter biscuit - Went with friends on a Saturday morning. Maple butter and fig jam on all butter biscuit was good, I could not taste the maple though. I definitely prefer all butter. My friends highly recommended the sandwich with fried chicken. The iPad and credit went down while we were next up on line. The cashier could not handle it and got very anxious and the kitchen sat idle for 5 minutes as no orders poured it. Once he took our orders by hand we got our food immediately since 8 people had nothing to do. Everybody behind us was pretty screwed waiting in line for what I imagine would be at least 20 minutes.

3. I think they pre bake their biscuits at night and you risk getting the dry tasteless ones - went at 11 PM on a Saturday and got a Kiki and maple, grape both on all butter.  Spent 6 minutes (timed it) in a 3 person but the food came quicker than my first trip. Nothing impressive about these. My roommate had half of each for the first time and agreed they were nothing special.

they have a good amount of recommended macs and cheese combinations that definitely sound interesting - buffalo chicken, masala etc

you can also order your mac and cheeses with multi-grain or gluten free pasta, a nice touch if you have dietary requirements

if you don't like any of the recommendations, you can let your creative culinary taste loose and make your own

there was a decent amount of beers on tap here and bottled beer - mostly craft beers which is bonus points in my book as i prefer this then your typical brands such as coors light

i opted to order the regular 4 cheese dish thinking ""hey this place is known for mac and cheese (hence the name of the place) so their basic dish should be awesome"" - this is where it went downhill for me

a lot more cheese in this then i like, at some point it felt like i was just eating melted cheese and no mac - don't get me wrong, i like cheese a lot but not in a liquid form in this big of an amount

I ordered fries and chicken fingers, and the guy said it would take about 45 minutes. About an hour and a half later, I called back and asked where my order was. He said they should be there in a minute. I said ok and hung up, only to receive my order a half hour later. At first, the delivery man did not want to make the simple walk up the front steps.

I thought about it and realized this is the only meal where I've eaten something I don't eat weekly in a month (almost everything else I eat is cooked from scratch by me). It feels a lot like food poisoning. I don't know if this is a one-off incidence, but no restaurant should have a passing health inspections rating and give any patron food poisoning. Don't come here. There are better eats in this neighborhood that are cheaper and better quality food.",0.11069397633274615,0
Ive never complained about the food until one time when my entire family actually got food poisoning from this place! and atop of that the delivery man got nasty with me because I paid him in a dollar coin since I was told on the phone a different price so I didn&#39;t have in dollars the amount that he requested. Im extremely disappointed in this place. NEVER AGAIN.,0.051243273531711951,0
"The food is all right. I order a lot of omelets from here since they have a good selection. I'm a little frustrated with Coral though; I always request no home fries or French fries with my omelets. The frying oil upsets my stomach and when they package it all together even eating just the omelet will make me sick. However they NEVER follow my instructions to not include the home fries!  I'm happy to pay the same price, I don't know why they can't just not include all the fried stuff. It's pretty frustrating, especially when there are so few dining options in this area. 

Coral, please stop ignoring the ""special instructions"" box on Seamless!  It makes me think you don't give a damn about your customers!",0.022355526059288078,0
"Horrible food. 

My co-workers and I ordered from this spot today and it was just disgusting. The herbed fries that came with my burger were cold and flavorless. The herbs on the fries were obviously not incorporated in the batter and it was just a bunch of spices thrown on top of fries. The bun on the burger was soggy and fell apart when I bit into it. The meat tasted bland. Aside from that, my co-worker ordered chicken pot pie, and it came in the form of a soup (which was the filling) in a separate container, with the crust that came completely separately. When we called to complain, the customer service was unaccommodating - very rude. 

I wish I can just rate it as negative stars, because now I feel sick and want to throw up. Ugh.",0.071534689448645272,0
"I got very sick from eating here.

The young guys that keep the buffet filled, place the empty trays on top of the full trays when swiching them.  Can you picture lifting a tray from the steam table and placing the bottom of it onto the top of a tray full of food?  This is what they do.  I saw it but didnt take it seriously enough.  I got sick that night - very very sick.

Placing dirty metal (these trays have been on countertops, etc.) onto food!

I will never eat from there again and I warn you that what you don&#39;t see them do could be worse than what I saw them do!

"Came to this place for the first time and had a really great experience. I called to reserve a table for 8 only 30 mins prior to arriving and when we arrived they had a table prepped and ready for us. The jalapeño watermelon margaritas were amazing. We ordered the tacos and the favorite of the table was the carne de res with the mushrooms and cheese. Not something I would typically have gone for but whoa are they good. Our waitress, SARA, was very attentive and made our experience so much better. I have been getting really sick of going to restaurants and having the waitstaff act like they are doing me a favor by doing their job. Sara was seriously the best server I have had in Williamsburg in a long time. 
I give it 4 stars bc I think the food is a little pricey and the portions are pretty small. They also only take reservations for the inside and not the patio. Even with that being said I am sure I will be back to check out their rooftop patio.",0.052575559302216517,0

"This is hands down the worst dining experience of my life. My boyfriend and I were going to eat at Buttermilk Channel but due to a wait, and no room at the bar we decided to go next door for a drink. Although it was against my better judgement my boyfriend suggested that we stay at Mezcal for dinner. What a mistake.

The bartender barely made eye contact and took no interest in us or our experience while making a strong and undrinkable margarita with cheap sour mix. We told him that we wanted to move out to the outdoor seating area for dinner and when we did we sat there for 15 minutes with no service, no menus, no water until I asked a 10 year old boy for menus. It was probably another 20 or more before anyone took our order. Despite having asked for the salad first it was another 30 minutes until we received our food. The salad was not dressed, the spicy shrimp dish was so spicy that it was flavorless and barely edible, and the seafood in the other dish was overlooked and bland. The waitress didn't come to ask us how things were for at least 20 minutes at which point we both felt sufficiently ill and just wanted to leave. Despite having asked for a check another 10 minutes went by at which point we went to the bar for our check. The check totaling $75 for two margaritas, guacamole, and two entrees was a slap in the face for such shitty service and terrible Mexican food. Furthermore my boyfriend and I spent the night feeling horribly sick. In retrospect if we hadn't wanted to leave so quickly because we felt so sick I might have asked for a manager. 

Save yourself and avoid this restaurant at all costs.""",0.30739087841840362,1
"Never eat here! Stopped here for dinner with my boyfriend after several recommendations and ended up with a terrible experience and FOOD POISONING.

My bf got the lasagna, and I got the veal osso buco. The manager/owner Joey was very friendly, and the house Chianti was tasty. That's where any good experience ended.

The food arrived quickly - too quickly. Seven minutes of wait time isn't even enough to heat precooked food up in the microwave. The veal was tender, but exceptionally bland. The risotto was the worst I've ever had. It was soupy and flavorless. When we complained, Joey offered us some gnocchi, which was, if possible, worse. The pasta was overcooked, and the brownish sauce on top was unidentifiable. Topped off with some Kraft parmesan cheese, it was a plate full of nasty.

The lasagna was steaming hot. The noodles were overcooked. The cheese on top was barely melted, however, and the meat and sauce combination, tasted mediocre and came with a side of thirty six hours of gastrointestinal upset.

The only other positive comment I have, is that they didn't charge extra for the food poisoning.",0.27768532871415458,0

"For Long Island City, it doesn&#39;t get much better than this. 

My girlfriend and I thankfully stumbled upon this place while heading to the bank and it might just be our new favorite spot. After being disappointed so many times in our neighborhood (Blend, Skinnys Cantina, Shi, Masso, etc) we finally had a meal where everything we ordered was excellent.

We&#39;ll need to come back a few times and explore the rest of the menu, but today we had the chips and salsa (a mix of standard chips, plantains and crispy eggplant slices with a sampling of salsa and hummus), a beet/aruglua/goat cheese salad, yuca gnocchi and a curried chicken pizza. Everything was absolutely delicious and much cheaper than we expected. We would have easily paid double in Manhattan without complaining a bit.

Someone complained about the small size of the plates but I think they were nitpicking a bit. The gnocchi dish (our favorite) was on the smaller side but the chips/salsa plate was huge by comparison (we were almost full after eating just that) so I recommend asking your server about the size of each dish prior to ordering.

The GM Josh was a super cool Aussie guy who makes you feel like you&#39;re the most important guests in the house. Since we visited on a Monday afternoon, I cant vouch for the service in the evening but we will definitely come back and find out for ourselves. However, we&#39;ll probably come back first for the amazing brunch specials we read about.

So if you&#39;re looking for something new in LIC and you&#39;re sick of being disappointed then check out Open Door and for the love of God, please try the yuca gnocchi.",0.15692641210113425,0
"Aki gets three and a half stars and the half star bump up because, it is what it is.

Aki is a discount sushi place with decent sushi.

There is a lot of competition on the block for sushi.  Aki is the clear price winner, hands down, blind folded.

There is no pretentious anything at Aki.  They have a menu.  They are well decorated and clean.  They half half price sushi.  They will take your order then leave you to whatever it is you do besides eat.  The rolls are really well priced.

Every salmon combination I have tried is good, including the New York roll with apple and mayo.

If you are looking to impress someone, there are places with nicer decor on the block.  If you want to eat, not break the bank and get a pretty no frills, cheap experience, without worrying about getting sick or having gas station like sushi, Aki wins hands down.

Sundaes and Cones is the best.

Even as a classicist when it comes to ice cream flavors, I just can't resist the stuff they come up with: Thai Tea?? Lavender?! Come smother my face with this ridiculousness, please.

I don't know how they do it, what kind of dark magic they use, but all the ice cream here have simultaneously the 2 characteristics of: 1) so creamy that all you want to do is swim in a pool of it, but you wouldn't be able to move your limbs due to the thickness and would therefore drown and die (but what a way to die); and 2) intense flavoring that reach out with their little dairy fists and punch you in the face. I went in to try the pumpkin today, and the coconut. I was definitely punched. Ohmigod. Assault me. Assault me good.

"I was skeptical ordering from here since I&#39;ve never had sushi that was Kosher but I must say that i was pleasantly surprised.  The food is great.  The prices are decent.  

I have two gripes with the place:
1. They observe the Jewish Sabbath so their hours of business are not those of the typical restaurant.  We have learned this a couple of times when we wanted some sushi after work on a Friday and they were already closed.

2. When they are open, they do not always deliver.Twice in the last 2 months I have called for delivery and was told that they could not deliver that night (I live 3 blocks away.).  Only once was I told a reason: the delivery guy was out sick.  I don&#39;t know if the missing delivery guy was the reason for the first delivery refusal but both times this place lost $40+ of business that night.

I would suggest to Yama that they work out their delivery issues and perhaps work on hiring someone who can operate the business during the Sabbath.  I&#39;ve seen the owner and he is ALWAYS there.  Other than the sushi chef I never see any other employees so I&#39;m guessing he must close the business for religious observance.  

Of course this is his business to operate as he sees fit but I suspect that not keeping standard hours is literally leaving money on the dinner table to other sushi places in the area which do not seem to be as good as Yama.",0.037977754591513778,0

"This is the most splendid restaurant...if you don't care about food or money.

Will your out of town friends be totally impressed with your ability to get into a sick looking place last minute on Friday night?  Damn right they will, and the decor of the place is not to be skipped over, its mastered the correct blend of hip meatpacking night club with elements of my grandmother's farmhouse in China.  Modern with vibrant colors, yet its got the same wood work and vases as grandma's house.

The problem with this place is that the food looks beautifully plated and I want to believe it will be just as tasty as it's presented.  But its amazing how they can make such beautiful plates yet manage to suck out all the flavor and replace it with subpar fake chinese takeout restaurant quality flavor.  If they kept the same venue and replaced everything with Panda Express I might have 3 stared the place.

But my biggest gripe was the last time I went with a large group.  The waiter asked if we would like to split the appetizers so that everyone in our group could get a piece.  Who would say no to that?  And what a surprise it was, we got all this extra food!!  Too bad we ended up paying some ridiculous ""extra add on"" fee.  Come on, I thought this was a classy restaurant, not some used car dealership from hell.

"""Touristy so don't feel you need to wear your Choo's for dinner despite the location. I have seen out of town business types eat while surfing the web on the laptop they bring to dinner with them, and really frompy overweight weight tourists in flip flops here.  Bottom line: this isn't one of THOSE UES bistro's so don't bother bringing out your finest. 

The menu is somewhat limited, salads and meats from all animals. Didn't see mussels or omelets or even steak tartare that you would find in most other bistro's. The wine menu was disappointing and not very sophisticated. We had to send the first bottle of Burgundy back because I've had vinegar that were less tart. 

They have 4 small tables in the front if you're into outdoor dining. 

Food:
Appetizer: we had the truffel mac and cheese which was very good, and the lobster salad which featured a tough, chewy, overcooked chunks of lobster. For $24, I thought the latter was overpriced considering the portion and flavor. Oh, they forgot to put the bacon in the mac and cheese which would have made it even better. 

Main course: Sea bass and Branzino - both came with some veggies like roasted tomatoes that went bad threw days ago, and bland boiled fingerling potatoes. Everything was swimming in BUTTER. 

I walked out of their thinking the food wasn't bad, it was okay and the location was good enough for another visit. HOWEVER, I WOKE UP IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND THREW UP STRAIGHT FOR 5 HOURS!  I'm talking projectile kind of vomit that shoots up with very little notice that I almost threw up in the hallway before I got to the toilet. I continued to vomit until I had nothing more than froth shooting out of my mouth.  I will spare you what came out the other end because that would be gross. I had to call in sick the next morning when the frothing and cramping continued until 6am and I had gotten 30 minutes of sleep.

"I so wanted to love marble. It's hard to find a great steakhouse in New York anymore. Coming from Chicago I suppose my standards are high, but even for New York marble is at the bottom. The only reason for two stars is because it's very pretty. Has a great atmosphere. Although the night I was there they were taking photographs and kept changing the lighting which was slightly annoying during a Saturday evening dinner. As for the food-- we started with the fried oysters. In edible. Literally. I took one bite and instantly got sick I had to spit it out. Which I can safely say was a complete first for me. I'm really not picky so to spit something out meant it was baaaaad. Then I ordered a filet mignon med rare. Nice couldn't wait. So the appetizer was Awful- maybe their steak will be good- that is what they're supposed to be good at right? Uh no. So first I got a strip steak instead of the filet I ordered. Then I start to cut into it because after waiting ten minutes the waiter didnt come back. So 30% of it was fat and the other 70% was well done. Awesome- I'm officially done with marble at this point. But ok, ill try the Mac and cheese because the picture on yelp looked awesome so at the least this has to be good right? Wrong. It was super grainy. I think they use egg in their recipe (largely a Southern thing), which can be good- but in this case left the cheese sauce broken and gross. If it wasn't egg-- then possibly milk that went bad? Either way, not good. So I ask my date are you doing any better? Unfortunately, no. His steak and fries were eh and also cooked improperly. So sad- looked so promising. Worst part is on the way out someone (who I suspected was the chef -- came from the kitchen)... Asked us how our meal was. My date felt bad and said ""great, thanks""... Fast forward to me writing a yelp review because I think after such a disastrous meal- the owners/chef deserve to know the truth- without knowing where your faults are you can't improve...

"I really wanted to give this place a positive review because I'm a huge fan of mom-and-pop establishments, but I can't. It was pretty bad, even by cheap-Chinese-food standards. The main problem is that, although the portion sizes were generous, there was very little meat. My pepper steak with onions was mostly onions, with only a few pieces of small, fatty, chewy meat. Where's the beef? My sweet and sour pork (yes, I ordered two meals - one for that day, one for the next) was mostly just deep-fried flour and cornstarch. A couple of pieces didn't contain any pork at all. Also, my pork fried rice (which came with each entree) was mostly fried rice, with just a few tiny pieces of pork. (At least, I think it was pork.)

I found each meal surprisingly soggy, and the sweet and sour sauce tasted like pure vinegar. (Perhaps they just added red food coloring?) I felt kind of sick after eating the sweet and sour pork. Also, the delivery person lingered at the door for a tip, which was a bit awkward/uncomfortable since I had already put a 20% tip on the credit card. (I used the restaurant's online ordering service.)

Now that I've covered the negatives, let's get to the positives: The portion sizes were big, the prices were fantastic (five bucks for an entree, pork fried rice and egg drop soup? Can't beat that!), and the food arrived hot and fairly quickly. These positives simply don't make up for the problems discussed above, and if you're looking for quick Chinese food, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

"Stella 34 Trattoria is a clean and modern styled restaurant on the sixth floor of--this is happening--Macy*s. (I know.) I was initially a bit afraid of the restaurant choice but let me say, IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!

Love the ambiance--it's extremely refreshing! Amidst the chaos of shoppers, piles and racks of clothing, and--did I mention--shoppers. No really, tourist shoppers who blindly veer into walkways while looking in every direction but the right one. It's like being in Times Square where they are all looking up and drifting as they walk and, if you're really lucky, stopping out of nowhere. THAT (that = hellish chaos).

And then, whew, air, breathing, it's not a mirage--Stella 34 Trattoria.

Already worlds happier than seconds before, the night's experience continued to climb up and up.

To start, we had a few vegetable small plates to share. Not only were they super delicious but they were presented beautifully.

The plating of the food stayed much in the theme of the restaurant, there was a lot of white with vibrant pops of color. The white dishes emphasize the rich color combinations within the dishes, each one looking exciting and enticing--you just have to dive in!

Once you do dive in, it's incredibly flavorful. Clean and flavorful. By clean, I mean every ingredient stands out in the right way--with purpose. It's impressive.

The dining experience at Stella 34 Trattoria quickly turns from pure enjoyment to curiosity over every item on the menu. Each item that we ordered was so good it made me want to try all of those dishes that I ruled out in the decision making process. (I suppose that's what brings people back to a restaurant. But in the moment I felt like a four-year-old having a tantrum because I want to eat more than I know I am capable of and would result in getting sick. I literally almost ordered a pizza after finishing my meal because my grandmother's looked so delicious.)

Beyond my obsession with the food plating, style, flavors, and overall deliciousness, is the service. THE SERVICE IS REMARKABLE. From the moment I entered the restaurant and was greeted, I knew I was in for a proper evening.

You see, I was offered a table before the rest of my party arrived. I was also given the option of enjoying a drink at the bar, or relaxing in the large lounge. When two more members of my party arrived, they were directed to the lounge--""there is a pretty girl waiting for you in the lounge""--I believe that she made a note of my location in her system. (fabulous service and compliment--too sweet!)

Wonderfully, that type of service extended to our waitress Sam. She was truly fabulous and extremely knowledgeable of the menu. She was able to have fun with us in a completely professional manner which only added to the exceptional experience that we had at Stella 34 Trattoria.

And then there's dessert (yes, I'm back on the food. And while I'm there, my ""Tortino Di Melanzane"" was excellent. I want it again right now as I drool over the photo I took of it). THE DESSERT IS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DINNER! It's composed and thoughtful--just look at those textures, yum.

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BEING TOO PREPARED--AND STELLA 34 TRATTORIA OBVIOUSLY KNOWS IT! Shopped too long and don't have time to cook for the family? Just don't feel like sitting down to a meal? Like a moth to a flame got pulled towards the lit display case filled with deliciousness?

Yes, they have it all! Not only do they have a prepared food section--I know, ""not only""--but they have a gelato counter, too. Amazing. Take it all with you--no fuss, no muss. What a perfectly thought out experience! I can't wait to go back. CHEERS!",0.022230866735475155,0

I liked the spices on the sweet potatoes although I would say in general the salt potatoes were too salty and the sweet too sweet. I this place could be a a 4 star, if i didnt feel like their plan was the just clog your arteries with one visit.",0.019544782881354323,0
The food was completely horrible.  It was all greasy and did not taste good at all.  My boyfriend and I actually got very sick afterwards and were vomiting.  We will obviously never order from this place again.  Stay away!,0.36557280088800126,1
"Came here on a saturday night with a few gfs.  One of the primary reasons for choosing this place was b/c of the mussels featured on their menu, and a resulting search for &#34;gastropub&#34;.  
I&#39;m not sure i can really call this place a gastropub.. its just a pub.. with extremely mediocre food.  The place wasn&#39;t that crowded at 9pm, so not sure why they were out of the mussels, highly disappointed.  The waiter suggested the salmon burger, sure why not.  I&#39;ll tell you why not.. TERRIBLE.  The fishiest tasting salmon burger i have ever had in my life. Mushy would best describe it. I honestly felt sick afterwards, thank goodness i only had a few bites, ugh.  My friend got the oyster sliders...she only ate 1.5/3.
It was too dark in there to tell but.. whats up with the curry ketchup? yuck.
My friend had the pork sliders, those were much much better, and i would recommend getting if you found yourself upon this place.  
Service-a little snooty for a pub don&#39;t you think? A shame, the venue itself has a lot of potential... alas..we won&#39;t be back.",0.075525310381456254,0
"I would give zero if I could. This is the worst Restaurant I have ever been at! 

We only went in to that Taco bell because it was 96 degrees outside and we wanted to get some cool Air. The place we originally wanted to stay at had no AC and basically yelled food poisoning but would have been the better choice.

So, let&#39;s start with the completely depressing, run down look. We where the only customers  on a Saturday afternoon. Most of the tables where really dirty and the chairs had ripped and worn off. 

When I ordered my food, the casher was completely unable to use the register. It took him like 10 minutes to take my order, he got it wrong and charged me more than it was, since he was unable to figure our the lunch-box thing... He then forgot my cup and after I asked for it, he gave me neither a straw nor a lid. 

i ate half of the food that he gave me, then threw it away since i was to afraid to get food poisoning and it tasted like nothing. 

I was so glad to get out of there and swore to myself: never again!",0.08422920360907489,0
"Our recent Dino experience began with waiting on the bartender to finish arguing with her friend / partner / nemesis before she angrily procured our take out order and ended with a night of projectile vomiting during which I relived the waves of black pepper and cayenne pepper that dominated and nearly ruined every overpriced morsel of chicken, pork, beef and macaroni and cheese we ate. The fried green tomatoes were good--at least going down. Not so good coming back up. Egh.",0.32777036713935753,0
"I really loved this place, but I did get sick after eating there, and feel like I had something that must have been contaminated.  Actually, the breading on the fried duck seemed very undercooked, which may have been the issue.  Ultimately, you never want that to occur, but I think mistakes happen, and since no one else has complained about a similar experience, I think it was probably an isolated incident, which is why I am being generous with my rating.

Food was good and well priced.  Service was outstanding--super nice.  I also really enjoyed the beverage menu.",0.061461772467233056,0

Disgusting. I ordered their chicken and veggies soup for delivery... I'm less than 2 blocks away but I was sick and couldn't pick up. The soup came within 20 min but was barely lukewarm... And the only remnants of chicken was ONE disgusting piece of chicken skin. You read that correctly. There was no chicken in my soup except for a piece of chicken skin.,0.032332697446034904,0
"Party of 12 on a relatively quiet Thursday evening. Everyone who had beef burgers got sick that night with food poisoning. Vomiting, diarrhea, it happened to eight of us. If that wasn&#39;t bad enough, our waitress was incompetent. In one case, one of us ordered a beef burger, and a chicken burger showed up. When the chicken was sent back, the same chicken burger came back out but with ketchup on it. Another one of us ordered a milk shake which never showed up. Again, it was not busy the night we were there. Fries were way too greasy as well. Never going back.",0.39810911059059589,1
"3.5 

I would say the theme of the dinner was truffle! I was not complaining. Came here with  a group and we got to sit at a round table which was perfect. The meal started off with complimentary bread that came with an herb aioli. This was a decent start. There were six of us and we shared the shellfish platter for four. There was tuna, crab claws, and shrimp that were all fresh and tasty. I sampled my boyfriends pumpkin soup that had shavings of truffle on it and it was delish. For entree, I had the wild striped bass which was my least favorite part of the meal. It smelled fishy and tasted fishy. I ate half and thankfully did not get sick. It came with cabbage that had truffle on it so that made up for the smelly fish. Some side dishes that I sampled were the creamed spinach, truffle parmesan fries and mac and cheese. All of these sides were good except I wish the fries were crispier. For dessert, we shared two orders of the ice cream mini cones and the birthday cake. The birthday cake was the star. It was so whimsical looking with a caramelized piece of sugar that had sprinkles inside and cupcake frosting on it. It also had rainbow fruit loop looking pieces on it that just made the dish really pretty. The restaurant itself is gorgeous which made it a special dinner.",0.065109628548973425,0
"Okay for real the only reason I'm even posting a review is because I had to make an account to review another place for a class.

This place used to be my favorite thing in the city. I was in love, I told every tourist who asked me for directions about it. My Italian suitemate told me it was the closest thing to home she could find. I went so many times all the pasta guys knew me. I used to go when I was having a bad day just so the pasta could cheer me up. I went so many times I had a favorite pasta chef, Antoine. He is incredible. I don't know if you could taste the love your mom put into the hot chocolate she made when you were sick, but Antoine had a way of putting that same love into his dishes. He took pride in his work and always gave me extra tomatoes and basil :). 

Anyways, I went on a trip to London for a month, I came back and the first place I wanted to go was Vapiano to visit Antoine to temporarily cure me from the pain of the sh*t show my trip was. To my horror, he wasn't there. Whatever. I ask the guy making my pasta what day Antoine would be back and he had no idea who I was talking about. This was impossible, everyone knew him. A bus boy told me there was a fight with management and Antoine and 6 others had quit. My heart broke into a million pieces. Every time I have gone back since (this happened a year ago) it's been disappointing. No one cares anymore. They burn the sauce and put like a leaf of basil and one little cherry tomato. All I want is Antoine's cooking. I wish I knew where he went :(",0.0087346531209574196,0
"I went to this establishment since I heard so many good things about it. Boy, were they wrong. The service was bad, the $36 crab legs weren't seasoned/cooked properly and drinks came in a small plastic cup, like the ones you get at the dentists office. Worst of all, after I left, the food got me sick! I was unable to hold anything down the rest of the night. All I can say is this will be my first and last time attending this establishment.",0.060392632049199348,0

"I really, really WANT to love Cebu. I have had fun experiences there with friends, colleagues and family. However, on more than one occasion either myself or someone I was with has gotten sick after eating at Cebu.

 One night we took a family friend here for dinner and my fiance had to rush home right after because he had stomach issues. Another time I got really sick from eating pasta and drinking wine. Last night I ended up getting sick after eating a few pieces of calamari and 2 vegetable spring rolls. I am quite certain that many, if not all food items, are not made fresh. It is a tiny step up from chain restaurant food. 

 I love wine and I am a bit of a wine nerd. The wine at Cebu is of poor quality. Any wine that I have tried is extremely acidic and makes my stomach sour and my head ache almost instantaneously. 

 On the plus side, the waiters at our work parties have always been attentive, professional, and nice.

 If they would improve the quality of the food and drinks about 20 notches it has potential to be a fantastic spot in Bay Ridge. As of now, this place is extremely disappointing and I will not be returning.",0.10926015193552542,0
"First this place gives you A TON of food, a fish sandwich is enough for two people.  Also it isn&#39;t even really a sandwich it&#39;s just two pieces of bread with like 8 pieces of giant fried fish put in between, so when it comes to quantity they sure are not lacking.

Problems arise when it comes to the fish its self, I mean it&#39;s pretty good, but the way they fry it I almost always find myself feeling kind of sick after gorging on fish here.  Maybe it&#39;s just that I eat to much of the damn fish, but, I don&#39;t think so.  Also the line to order is often long then the wait after can be over 20 minutes.  One thing I really love here is the fried clams, I find them to be much tastier than their fish...but once again a problem...they are always out often.

Great place to try, a real judgement call, but sure not the best fried fish I have ever had, the sides are nothing to write home about either.

They do have a letter from Obama to them though which is pretty cool I guess.  Also what in the world is up with the guy dressed in fatigues with a camera who sits outside all day everyday?",0.012706172371008516,0
"Two unpleasant words: FOOD POISONING. 



After eating here, I was stricken with a bout of food poisoning that definitely made me an unhappy camper. Regardless of whether or not I had gotten sick though, I wouldn&#39;t have returned as the food could most generously be described as mediocre. 



Whipped Ricotta &amp; Nduja: Three small silvers of focaccia with the whipped ricotta and nduja on top that could be finished in two bites. There was literally no flavor at all. I kept trying to figure out what nduja tasted like, and constantly searched for the taste of ricotta or even the focaccia, but alas - nothing. I might as well have not eaten anything at all. 



Prosciutto Wrapped Dates: Just the opposite. These were sickly sweet. To the point of having to douse each bite with water. Each time I took a bite my mouth became sticky and hard to chew. 



The Bone Marrow: Ah, their namesake dish. The marrow itself overpowered the sea urchin. And the bread that it came with was charred to a blackened shadow of its former self. I have a sneaking suspicion that the sea urchin was what made me sick. I&#39;ve eaten tons of sea urchin before (yum), but this time I could sense it was off and the texture was odd. Scary to think their most popular dish could&#39;ve gotten me sick! 



Blistered String Beans: We needed a veggie dish. Overall it was ok as well. The tiny portion couldn&#39;t justify 12 dollars though. 



Pork Belly: This was their special of the day, and the waitress really pushed it. As an individual who loves pork belly, I was also disappointed by this. They did some sort of caramelizing to the top and bottom, but when eaten it would turn into a sticky, sticky mess that was impossible to swallow. I ended up having to cut away the caramelized part and just eating the middle. Such a sad waste. 



Overall, their only saving grace was their tiny pretzel rolls. But the waitstaff seemed reluctant to give us seconds, and quickly took our bread plates away and olive oil without asking if we&#39;d like refills. Such a shame that such an expensive meal was wasted.",0.03290435519887841,0
"you&#39;d think that after studying and passing the new york bar exam i&#39;d be sick to my stomach at the idea of sitting in another coffee shop . . . ahh, but you&#39;d be wrong. turns out my comfort zone IS the coffee shop. pleasant people watching, delicious cup o&#39; brew, typically great music, and an escape into my thoughts and ideas. yes, coffee shops are places where i can zone out and read and write to my heart&#39;s content.

it was a great surprise to find birch, just one subway stop away from my apartment. i had known of the flat iron location for quite some time but just never made it there. and while i had every intention of making lenox coffee my go-to neighborhood coffee shop, i&#39;m a tiny little gal. and tiny little gals probs shouldn&#39;t go too far uptown into harlem alone at night. (yo, i&#39;m just being real . . . can never be too careful!) hence, my venture to 96th street one sunday evening.

i didn&#39;t really know what to expect from birch. but, i definitely have high standards for coffee shops (check out my list - &#34;it&#39;s espresso, not expresso&#34; for all my coffee shop adventures).

aside from the fact that i walked in and stood at the counter for a solid 2-3 minutes before i was greeted (looks like a baristo was socializing with some guests), i was pleasantly surprised.

the space is significantly large, but not dangerously cavernous (take note, bourbon coffee). the menu is extensive - i noticed a dinner menu and beer, but settled for a decaf cafe au lait. the baristo was super nice and helpful. the music selection was on point. and perhaps my favorite part . . . CANDLES! yes, there are tiny candles at each table. shut up. i dunno . . . there&#39;s just something beautiful about a cute coffee shop, candlelit at night, great music playing. ya see . . . i&#39;d rather fall in love with someone at a coffee shop (or library) than at some random bar. shrug.

i didn&#39;t use the Internet (strictly a reading and writing sort of night), so i can&#39;t attest to how good or bad it is.

regardless, i plan on being a frequent customer here. and i&#39;m hoping i get better service next time i visit. not that service was terrible - i&#39;m being picky here. but, it seems rather rude to ignore a customer for almost 3 minutes, especially when the place isn&#39;t packed. but, i&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt.",0.029087774389063469,0
"So I've been hanging out in Astoria now for roughly about almost 3 years and am familiar with the Long Island City/Astoria part, the Steinway area (my fave!) and the Broadway into Ditmars part. I've seen Doyle's bar and walked by it now for almost a year and a half at this point...since July when my boyfriend moved up the block from this bar. 

It looks like a regular, Irish pub from the outside - charming, yet being a Manhattan native I've seen my share of Irish pubs and each time I walked by I wanted to hop in, but didn't because well...no real reason, but with so many bars in the area we just never made it in here.

Last Friday I went to my beau's apartment from work, he wasn't home as he was doing laundry to prepare for his bestie from CT who was visiting and staying over the next day. We went in the direction of the Laundromat but realized we had 35-40 minutes to kill. He was flushed, a little clammy and not feeling so great. Wasn't entirely sure whether or not he had a fever, but definitely sure he was a little sick or coming down with something. 

He wanted a Hot Toddy and felt it would help make him feel better. I wanted an ice cold beer as I had a rough week, so I suggested Doyle's since it's on the corner and right by his Laundromat. SO HAPPY I did. This charming pub has many redeeming qualities:

1.) Newly remodeled - I had never seen the inside before so I honestly can't speak as to what it was like before, but now it's got comfy booths, dim sexy lighting (not too dark, just right!), simple/minimalistic light fixtures give it a nice, classy pub feel - was totally surprised as the outside (in my opinion) doesn't match the inside, this isn't a bad thing - just an observation.

2.) Bathrooms - Yes, this is a QUALITY. People go to bars to drink, drinks make us want to tinkle. Being able to tinkle in a clean bathroom is all too often a luxury at a bar. I literally stopped in my tracks when I entered a clean smelling bathroom with a squeaky clean new steel sink & faucet, clean toilets, perfectly kept stalls, no graffiti or etchings...it was amazing. One of the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen at a bar. Awesome.

3.) Prices - Food menu is your average Irish bar foods, but everything sounds pretty delicious and I've heard that the Irish Nachos here are to die for. I'll definitely check them out next time I'm here. My boy's Hot Toddy (and other cocktails) are $6 (not awful, especially when it's heavy handed and well made). Jameson on the rocks is $6 and beers on draft (imported and domestic) are $6 all day, every day and I was really impressed to see Blue Moon's Agave Nectar on tap here along with Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier (a Hefeweizen style beer brewed by Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan in Freising, German) which I totally got my boyfriend into. He described it as ""oooh, that's refreshing!"" and he's right. Not many Irish bars have a spectacular draft beer selection, kudos Doyle's :).

4.) Friendly Bartender - Friday night the man in charge of the bar was Brendan. Brendan is friendly a hoot and gave me a generous sample of Blue Moon's Agave Nectar in a pretty crystal class. He also makes a MEAN Hot Toddy. If I remember correctly he also had a light Irish accent. Winning.

Doyle's is a real neighborhood bar and a great place to WATCH SOCCER on their wall-mounted flat screens, enjoy some food and have a good time away from college frat boys and other annoying folk. 

Also the jukebox here is FANTASTIC and was churning out awesome music - any bar that plays Johnny Cash and Arctic Monkeys gets several golden stars in my book. Love this place and will probably be a regular in no time :).",0.014283005850510651,0
