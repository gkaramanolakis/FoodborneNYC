While the service has always been abysmal, yesterday&#39;s Choice experience left me vowing never to return. \\n\\nMy co-workers and I placed an order via Seamless for pickup.

Upon asking them, &#34;Well, what are my options?&#34; The guy rudely said &#34;Um. A refund?&#34; Well, as I mentioned, the refund never came and I had to call Seamless, who very quickly resolved the matter.\\n\\nNow, as far as the food itself...it was off. My co-worker and I both ordered the steak panini and the steak in it tasted really REALLY off. We both noticed this and ended up removing the meat from the sandwich, but not until after we ate the first half of it. It tasted like old meat. I can&#39;t really describe it, but it was terrible.

Well, as cliche as it may be, both of us ended up sick with severe stomach cramps from it!\\n\\nI can&#39;t in good conscience ever order from here again.
